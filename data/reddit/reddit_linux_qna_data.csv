Fedora With Latest AMD CPU's?,"Fedora 42. I am looking to upgrade my system and may go with the latest Ryzen 9's. Just wondered how they are with Fedora? Does everything work ok? Just didn't want to spend a lot of money to build a new system with Fedora as the main OS to find the latest processors aren't supported. 

Thank you",AMD drivers are supported even better compared to Intel's in Fedora :)
Games run significantly worse on Fedora vs Windows 10,"I'm running Fedora 42 KDE version. I have an Nvidia card (4070 super) and installed the drivers following a guide by youtuber SkyeVR. Games run but run significantly worse. modinfo -F nvidia says 570.153.02. I made sure the energy settings are on power over balanced. Everything is updated as far as I'm aware.

Examples: Elden ring runs at about 45-50 FPS compared to a solid 60 on windows with the same settings. FFXIV I get anywhere from 30-40 frames less than on windows in any given situation. WIndows it's usually over 100, sometimes capped at 144, only dipping below 100 in populated areas. On Fedora, it rarely even hits 100.

My computer is not MAINLY for gaming, though I do it often, so I was hoping for a more general OS as opposed to a gaming focused one. Supposedly this is just fine for gaming, so I don't know what my issue is. 

Googling I find posts saying Wayland doesn't play well with Nvidia, and to switch to Xorg, but also that Xorg is no longer in Fedora. With other people saying Wayland is perfectly fine now.

I kept hearing gaming using Nvidia is still fine, is that wrong or are there other things I should check? I'm also not sure what other info I should provide.

Edit: Thanks for everyone's advice and info. I can't torubleshoot further for now, but I will continue messing around and see what I can do. If I intend to give up, I'll try a gaming distro and see if that runs better. If anyone has further suggestions, I'm happy to hear them and I'll try them as I get time.

edit 2: I decided to try bazzite just to see how performance was, and I was running into basically the same issues. I don't think it's a distro problem. I have decided to wipe my fedora boot and just partition it for windows sadly. I already needed to keep windows around due to old music hardware and some other programs that just don't play nice on linux at the moment. If I end up using it for games too, then that doesn't leave a lot for me to do in the linux install. Or at least, not enough to justify keeping it on one of my main drives.

Next time i build a PC I intend to go with AMD and specifically build it around running Linux on it. In the mean time, I have a fedora install on a USB drive that I've been screwing around with, so I can continue screwing around with it as I wish. And I think I'll try running some other distros that I haven't checked out yet in a virtual Machine just to see what they're all like, and maybe start learning some of the more advanced ones. Thank you all again for the advice. Sadly this didn't work out for me, and not even for any fault of the OS or Distro itself. In fact I genuinely loved it otherwise.","From the sounds of it, I might just be giving up on linux for now. Maybe on a different PC build in the future."
How do I get DNF to not download packages from Russia?,"I just tried to run a 'dnf update', and got a bunch of 404s from Russian hosts. That was some temporary blip and fixed itself shortly, but I really don't want my machine to download packages from Russian mirrors. So how can I disable the Russian mirror, or mirrors from other hostile states?

(I know that Fedora uses signing to verify the integrity of packages downloaded from mirrors. I don't care. My machine still reaches out to them behind my back, which I don't like. You don't have to tell me getting my packages from Russia is safe. I decide that for myself.)",How hard is it to skim through 12 pages and find your country's mirror? Go the page 6 and then look if your country is before or after the current listed countries. Then go to page 3 or page 9 depending on the previous decision. Do that again and you'll find your country.
Desktop freezes on kernel 6.14.8,"Today, after updating the kernel to version 6.14.8, my computer went crazy - desktop kept freezing, and hard reboot was necessary, I had to revert back to version 6.14.6.

"Serious mouse cursor/input issues in apps on Fedora GNOME (Wayland, AMD GPU) — any solutions?","Hi everyone,

I'm encountering a frustrating issue on **Fedora (GNOME + Wayland)** after recent updates. I’m running an **AMD GPU**

Initially, I noticed the **mouse cursor would sometimes not change shape** when hovering over links, text fields, or file icons. After a more recent update, the problem got worse: in **some apps like VSCode, Google Chrome, and Steam**, the mouse stops interacting with the window entirely — no hover effects, no clicks, nothing. The keyboard still works, but the mouse becomes useless *for that window*.

The only temporary workaround I’ve found so far is **Opening a new window of the same app sometimes “revives” mouse interaction** in the original one.

I've attached a **video** showing the issue happening.

Some details:

* Fedora 42 (fully updated)
* GNOME on Wayland (not using X11, and I would like to avoid switching to it)
* AMD GPU with open-source Mesa drivers
* Affected apps: VSCode, Google Chrome, Steam
* No custom cursor themes or extensions
* Some users suggest this is caused by a combination of **Wayland + Electron/Chromium drag-and-drop bugs**, and others mention issues with cursor themes not loading correctly under Wayland. In my case, I'm using default system themes and haven't done any cursor customization.

I'm wondering:

* Is anyone else on Fedora Wayland (with AMD GPU) seeing this?
* Are there reliable workarounds **without switching to X11**?
* Could this be a Mutter or Mesa bug?

Adding Snapper (or Timeshift) to Fedora. Is there a better way?,"I have been thinking of adding snapper to fedora using [this guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/1ap556b/how_to_setup_btrfsassistant_to_take_snapsots_in/kq5hy60/) & [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSyDgIuBDWU)

Need to add a file to /usr in Fedora Kinoite/Silverblue,"There is a project that adds gesture support for Logitech mice called logiops (https://github.com/PixlOne/logiops) and I was able to move the executable to /var/opt/userlocal/bin and edit the service file to point to that, so that's all easy peasy. The issue is there is a DBUS file that needs to go into /usr/share/dbus-1/system.d/ and that folder is read-only.

I already have a toolbox for building git repo programs made, and I'm wondering if I can somehow overlay the same folder from the container onto the host side?

I can't seem to find what I'm looking for via searches, so if this has been answered, then my Google-Fu wasn't good enough.

I know I can do `sudo ostree admin unlock --hotplug` and that would allow me to add the file but it doesn't persist across updates or adding layers (which I have since learned is something everyone does sparingly, so I'm going to have to tweak how I do things and make sure I'm really just adding things into a container) so I'm looking for a more permanent solution.","I don't think there's a trivial solution to using the actual folder under `/usr`, but I did stumble onto [this StackExchange thread](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/716032/how-do-i-add-another-dbus-service-file-search-directory) which says:

> The standard systemwide and per-session message bus setups are configured in the files ""/usr/share/dbus-1/system.conf"" and ""/usr/share/dbus-1/session.conf"".

I'm really confused about amd.,"So, I'm on nvidia currently but I want to switch. Are the mesa drivers packaged with fedora fine for gaming and stiff?

Help me pick a Fedora based distro.,"Hi, I've been a bit out of the loop, but basically I'd like to pick a Fedora based distro (my favorite Linux distro) that has full support for all codecs, mesa hardware acceleration, opens HEIC files, font rendering etc out of the box, also with a KDE edition and bonus points if it remains fairly vanilla without over the top themes and icon packs and a bunch of heavyweight apps pre-installed.

installing fedora besides windows 11 on Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro 16ACH6,"Hello, I wanted to install Fedora besides Windows. I need to keep Windows for work, but wanted to install Fedora since a long time. Do I need to pay attention to anything else during the installation? Will it work on my computer?

"Canonical, WHAT A SHAME !","Like thousands of other applicants, I went through Canonical’s extremely long hiring process (over four months: September 2024 → February 2025) for a software engineer position.

**TL;DR:** They wasted my time and cost me my current job.

The process required me to spend **tens of hours** answering pointless questions—such as my high school grades—and other irrelevant ones, plus technical assessments. Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Endless forms** with useless questions that took **10+ hours** to complete.
2. **IQ-style test** (for some reason).
3. **Language test**—seriously, why?

After passing those, I moved to the interview stages:

1. **Technical interview** – Python coding.
2. **Manager interview** – Career discussions (with the hiring team).
3. **Another tech interview** – System architecture and general tech questions.
4. **HR interview** – Career-related topics, but HR had no clue about salary expectations.
5. **Another manager interview** (not in the hiring team).
6. **Hiring lead interview** – Positive feedback.
7. **VP interview** – **Very positive feedback**, I was literally told, *""You tick all the boxes for this position.""*

Eventually, I **received an offer**. Since I was already employed, I resigned to start in four weeks. Even though the salary—revealed **only after four months**—was underwhelming, it was a bit higher than my previous job, so I accepted. The emotional toll of the long process made me push forward.

# And then, the disaster…

One week after accepting the offer, I woke up to an email from the hiring manager stating that, after further discussions with upper management, they had decided to cancel my application.

What upper management? No one ever mentioned this step. And why did this happen after I received an offer?

I sent a few polite and respectful emails asking for an explanation. No response. Neither from my hiring manager nor HR.

Now, I’m left starting from scratch (if not worse), struggling to pay my bills.

# My advice if you’re considering Canonical:

* Prepare emotionally for a very long process.
* Expect childish behavior like this.
* Never resign until you’ve actually started working.

I would never recommend Canonical to anyone I care about. If you're considering applying, I highly recommend checking Reddit and Glassdoor for feedback on their hiring process to make your own judgment.

P.S. :

\- If your company is recruiting in europe, and you can share that info or refer me. please do !","Copying from a previous comment I made:

This is a good case for promissory estoppel. You stopped looking for employment because they gave you an offer. If you have an offer letter from email, this is even better.

Get an employment lawyer like yesterday. You were cheated, and sounds like you have evidence to prove this.

Also I would like to add… fuck canonical. Their practices honestly show through how they butchered Ubuntu"
My grandma called and thanked me for installing Linux on her old computer,"My 83 year old grandma was using a virtually unusable late 00s E-Machines computer that still was running Windows Vista. All she ever does is check emails and google occasional recipes so I installed Linux Mint Cinnamon on it and she called me today to thank me for installing “such a fast version of windows on it.” She also loved that I made her wallpaper a photo of her youngest grandson, which she was surprised I could do :D

Just a reminder that Linux is a great option for grandparents","""fast version of windows"" lol."
"Facebook considers Linux and related topics a ""cybersecurity threat"", according to Distrowatch","As people have noticed in this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1i6zt52/meta_banning_distrowatchcom/ it seemed that Facebook has banned Distrowatch (and discussions related to Linux) from its site.

In their news today (https://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20250127#sitenews), Distrowatched shared the following:
> Starting on January 19, 2025 Facebook's internal policy makers decided that Linux is malware and labelled groups associated with Linux as being ""cybersecurity threats"". Any posts mentioning DistroWatch and multiple groups associated with Linux and Linux discussions have either been shut down or had many of their posts removed.

> We've been hearing all week from readers who say they can no longer post about Linux on Facebook or share links to DistroWatch. Some people have reported their accounts have been locked or limited for posting about Linux.

> The sad irony here is that Facebook runs much of its infrastructure on Linux and often posts job ads looking for Linux developers.

> Unfortunately, there isn't anything we can do about this, apart from advising people to get their Linux-related information from sources other than Facebook. I've tried to appeal the ban and was told the next day that Linux-related material is staying on the cybersecurity filter. My Facebook account was also locked for my efforts.",The only cybersecurity threat that I see is Meta itself.
Can we ban chatGPT posts/move them into a megathread,"I'm sorry but a tool to bounce stuff to an proprietary advanced auto-complete engine that mostly exists to harvest rube's data, has very little to do with linux other than you happen to call it from a linux box, and we don't need 4 posts about it on the front-page.

Why do you think Linux Torvalds is not as appreciated as Bill Gates or Steve Jobs when it comes to people who changed computing?,"Come to think of it, I think the invention of the Linux kernel has definitely changed the world.

On the desktop market, Linux-based systems constitute less than 3% of users. But that number is likely to be significantly higher if you take into account the people who actually care about computing in any capacity. It would rise by at least three times, I reckon, if more games had native Linux support.

Now, on the mobile market, Linux-based systems are installed on around half the phones in the world.

Most servers running the Internet are using a system based on the Linux kernel.

How come Linux Torvalds is not as widely recognized as Jobs or Gates? He's arguably done more than them, and that's without creating a gigantic chain of proprietary software/hardware to flood the market.

Why do you think that's the case? Shouldn't he be at least as well recognized as them?

"Can we stop calling user friendly distros ""beginner distros""","If we want people to be using linux instead of Windows or Mac OS we shouldn't make people think it's something that YOU need to put effort into understanding and belittle people who like linux but wouldn't be able to code up the entire frickin kernel and a window manager as ""beginners"". It creates the feeling that just using it isn't enough and that you can be ""good at linux"" when in reality it should be doing as much as possible for the user.


You all made excellent points so here is my view on the topic now:

A user friendly distro should be the norm. It should be self explanatory and easy to learn. Many are. Calling them ""Beginner distros"" creates the impression that they are an entry point for learning the intricacies of linux. For many they are just an OS they wanna use cause the others are crap. Most people won't want to learn Linux and just use it.
If you want to be more specific call it ""casual user friendly"" as someone suggested.
Btw I get that ""you can't learn Linux"" was dumb you can stop commenting abt it","Retired long-time linux user here. **9 years on Gentoo \~x86**, then 5 more on Ubuntu. I knew 1000+ Gentoo packages by name and function and many by build flags and dependencies.

"Richard Stallman's thoughts on ChatGPT, Artificial Intelligence and their impact on humanity","For those who aren't aware of Richard Stallman, he is the founding father of the GNU Project, FSF, Free/Libre Software Movement and the author of GPL.

Here's his response regarding ChatGPT via email:

> *I can't foretell the future, but it is important to realize that ChatGPT is not artificial intelligence.  It has no intelligence; it doesn't know anything and doesn't understand anything. It plays games with words to make plausible-sounding English text, but any statements made in it are liable to be false. It can't avoid that because it doesn't know what the words \_mean\_.*","My few points:

* It doesn't need intelligence to nullify human's labour.

* It doesn't need intelligence to hurt people, like a weapon.

* The race has now started. Who doesn't develop AI models stays behind. This will mean much money being thrown into it, and orders of magnitude of increased growth.

* We do not know what exactly inteligence is, and it might be simply not profitable to mimic it as a whole.

* Democratizing AI can lead to a point that everyone has immense power in their control. This can be very dangerous.

* Not democratizing AI can make monopolies worse and empower corporations. Like we need some more of that, now.

Everything will stay roughly the same, except we will control even less and less of our environment. Why not install GPTs on Boston Dynamics robots, and stop pretending anyone has control over anything already?"

Has anyone else found that their Windows IT knowledge has diminished greatly since moving to Linux?,"This is a bit of a fluff post, but I thought it'd be fun to discuss. Like most Linux users, I'm an ex-Windows user. Now when it came to windows, I considered myself rather adept at troubleshooting and solving windows problems. I was that guy in your family or friends group that was the default ""IT guy"" - no matter what problem you were having. Most of the time I was able to solve things, navigate around comfortably, try troubleshoot steps, the whole lot. *However...* Since I migrated over to Linux (full-time) about a year ago, I've noticed that a lot of the muscle memory and general knowledge about windows has just sort of... faded away.

I'm still the ""IT guy"" in my social circle, most of whom use windows, so I often get questions about how to do X or solve Y in windows 10/11. Up until a few months ago I was still pretty good at it, even without access to a machine running windows. Nowadays however, it's a completely different story. If it's not something *rather* obvious or easy to fix, I tend to struggle. A lot of it can be chalked up to ""wait, does windows allow you to do that?"" among desperate calls for a real terminal emulator with gnu coreutils.

When a friend has an issue on windows, my mind defaults to ""okay, open terminal, do XYZ, test, repeat, etc etc"" but then I realise I can't just tell my friends to type some terminal commands to solve their problem. Its really opened my eyes to the freedom Linux gives the user, both in terms of general computing & more advanced config. I know this post is just fluff, but I thought it was interesting. Especially as someone who had basically been using windows their whole life. **A lot** of that knowledge is just... gone.

I've taken to telling my windows friends ""I don't know how to troubleshoot your OS"" and it does the trick, ha.","Yeah, I feel ya. It's hard because troubleshooting Linux stuff teaches you to do smart, logical things. I still troubleshoot Windows stuff as my day job and most of the shit I do just doesn't make any fucking sense. Oh your software you just installed isn't working? Remove it and install it again! Why did that work? Who the fuck knows! Doing repeated actions and expecting a different outcome is the definition of insanity, on Windows it's normal."

[META] Stop Telling People to Reinstall,"Hopefully this isn't too much of a rant, but it's bothered me since I started following this sub.

I see reformatting/reinstalling recommended way too often and in situations that don't call for it. If you can't answer the actual question this is **not** a reasonable substitute.

It's one thing if the OP gives up and decides that route is easier, but telling someone to nuke their operating system is avoiding the question, not answering it.

Got shamed for using Linux.,"I switched to Linux some years ago and ever since then I've been using it and distro hopping as such. But my school don't like me using Linux since some of the application I have to use such as word and office 365 and OneDrive is not available. I have alternative for those ( libre office, onlyoffice and web office) they still say that I'm a nerd and a geek for using Linux. I also have difficulties socialising as I m very privacy focused person and uses only open source apps (except for discord). 
Should I buy another computer that is for school?
Should I switch to the apps they use that is non open source?


Thanks to everyone who helped me, this thread is now resolved. I have resorted to buying a spare windows machine that will do the job and some people suggested me some links to useful software and i will be sure to check them out and maybe i won't buy a computer if these software works out!

edit: I will stop replying to every comment,  i have made my decisions. If the VM thing and dualboot thing doesn't work out for me, i will either try to reskin my os to look like windows or just buy another laptop overall. 
also note i am a student so i keep this very vague and i didn't give much context, sorry for everyone who mis-understood the point of this thread. 

Takeaway
============
This thread was posted as i was angry at my school for how they operate. There were two views to this point.
First - I wasn't following instructions
second - they mis-use their powers to reduce marks. 
This thread was also posted as a sidenote that most International school curriculum (usually highschool) uses closed-source software or paid softwares. I just wanted to make this clear that, if the school are able to provide a license for that, then it's all good but some school uses cracked softwares which is illegal!",Why do you care what others think?
"Can we ban ""choose a distro for me"" posts please ?","EDIT: Can we **moderate*** would be more appropriate.

The sub is getting overwhelmed by this kind of posts. Currently, it's like 20% of all posts (exactly now, 3/12 of the most recent posts) That's too much.

I'm willing to hear others' opinions but this seriously feels like out of place here. I feel like those posts have their place in r/linux4noobs as the subreddit name clearly implies. There's also even an ad hoc distro-choice sub: r/findmeadistro .

Moreso, as is aforementioned, there are literally hundreds of such posts, and 90% of those submissions are always the same generic questions and considerations that have been answered countless times at great length, and which they could have trivially found with a bit of research. Each time I see the same comment threads over and over again and am seriously asking myself if this is the best use of this community.

Can we keep this sub about actual technical Linux questions where people could really need a hand ? And notably, where people won't (at least way less likely) also indulge in pointless political, opinionated and subjective debates.

PS: Of course, some posts can be justified where the needs are non-trivial, and I'm not asking for a 100% ban. This however could really be filtered heavily and leave room for more visibility on other questions.

Why do people choose Vim over Nano?,"I just don't get it. No hate, just need a legit explanation here. In my experience, Nano feels comfortable to edit in, but vim has me wrestle with achieving even the most basic tasks.

*EDIT: I'm way blown away with the responses (192 at time of writing). While obviously too hard to individually respond to everyone, thank you all so much for the helpful input!!*","Vim has a steep initial learning curve, but once you get over it, it is quite powerfull, as you can do text manipulation movements with ease.

Here is an excerpt from this article: https://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm

Subproblem #5a: Familiar is friendly

So it is that in most ""user-friendly"" text editors & word processors, you Cut and Paste by using `Ctrl-X` and `Ctrl-V`. Totally unintuitive, but everybody's used to these combinations, so they count as a ""friendly"" combination.

So when somebody comes to vi and finds that it's `d` to cut, and `p` to paste, it's not considered friendly: It's not what anybody is used to.

Is it superior? Well, actually, yes. 

With the `Ctrl-X` approach, how do you cut a word from the document you're currently in? (No using the mouse!)
From the start of the word, `Ctrl-Shift-Right` to select the word. 
Then `Ctrl-X` to cut it.

The vi approach? `dw` deletes the word.

How about cutting five words with a `Ctrl-X` application?
From the start of the words:

    Ctrl-Shift-Right
    Ctrl-Shift-Right
    Ctrl-Shift-Right
    Ctrl-Shift-Right
    Ctrl-Shift-Right
    Ctrl-X

And with vi?

    d5w

The vi approach is far more versatile and actually more intuitive: `X` and `V` are not obvious or memorable ""Cut"" and ""Paste"" commands, whereas `dw` to **d**elete a **w**ord, and `p` to **p**ut it back is perfectly straightforward. But `X` and `V` are what we all know, so whilst vi is clearly superior, it's unfamiliar. Ergo, it is considered unfriendly. On no other basis, pure familiarity makes a Windows-like interface seem friendly. And as we learned in problem #1, Linux is necessarily different to Windows. Inescapably, Linux always appears less ""user-friendly"" than Windows. 

To avoid #5a problems, all you can really do is try and remember that ""user-friendly"" doesn't mean ""What I'm used to"": Try doing things your usual way, and if it doesn't work, try and work out what a total novice would do."

"GitHub blocked in school for ""hacking""","First of all, I am aware that this is not the right subreddit to post this in but I feel like most here are probably well versed in this area.

Basically, GitHub is blocked on school WiFi (I go to a boarding school) because ""Content of type hacking"". I am aware that I could easily get around this with a VPN but I would like better options. This is a problem as I am quite involved with software development, issue reporting and this also breaks quite a few pieces of software (mainly AUR downloads)

How would I update and upgrade Hannah Montana Linux?,"Salutations, I hope everyone is well here. 

So, I have made it a personal goal of mine to update and upgrade Hannah Montana Linux, the old Linux OS back from 2009. When I do a Uname -a, it appears the OS is Linux Ubuntu 2.6.28-13 generic.  

So, I *almost* got there successfully, by replacing some instances in the sources.list file with old-releases.Ubuntu.com.  

Though, after attempting to distribution upgrade, after a while, the terminal states that Max Reports is reached and that there is no space left on the device. What I don’t understand is that I gave this live VM 50GB, so I thought it would be enough. Would I need more? What would I need to do to effectively upgrade this monstrosity? 


EDIT: I fixed the storage issue, but now there is an issue with releasing the upgrade. See this image

What advice do you have for my son who is into Linux?,"Crossposted from r/linux

My  son is in elementary school. For some weird reason, he is into Linux.  He reads books on Linux. Martin helmke, Linux Bible, cur rently reading  Linux Command Line, autobiography by Torvalds etc. He knows a lot of the  terminology - he says stuff related to KDE, GNOME, distro, etc. which I  dont understand. I am assuming that is fairly simple stuff but I cannot  tell how deep his knowledge goes.

I  looked up these forums and realized that he should not just read but  also actively do. So sometimes we sit together and tinker around with  the command line on his Raspberry Pi.

What  else should he be doing? He is in it purely out of interest. So can you  recommend any new activities, any other books? If he continues, what  should he do next? With coding, usually you make an app or create  websites etc when you are older. What do you do with knowledge in Linux?

Edit: Thanks to everyone for your comments and suggestions. I will look into each and everyone of them.",Just do what you're doing already. Go with the flow and you'll realise what you should be doing next.

Rant: This is not a do my homework for me sub.,"I've seen time and again posts crop up on here where OP has put sod all effort into their obviously assigned homework where they're meant to be LEARNING HOW TO SOLVE A PROBLEM but instead just copy paste their question in here expecting a quick answer and move on.  

Your teacher/instructor didn't spend time developing these exercises and tasks so you could get someone else to answer it for you without any understanding or learning taking place.

By all means ask a question if you're stuck, but show that you have put some effort in, explain what you have tried so far and why you think it didn't work.  You'll get a lot more people willing to help if you show that you actually got off your arse and tried to learn first.

I have just been told that I can't use Linux on my personal computer for school.,"3 years ago, I ""hacked"" the school (I actually just changed permissions on my user folder that the school gave me, so no one could access it). I was told not to do it again and that was pretty much the end of it. I have been using Linux as my main operating system for just over 2 years. In these 2 years there have been no problems with me doing this and many teachers knew that I was using it.

Just this week however, I was accused of ""hacking"" again, when actually it was another kid who was just ddosing the network so he had an excuse not to do work. Before they found him however, I was investigated because of what I did 3 years ago and was told that if I did not hand over my laptop and usbs, they would call in the police. Now, since the time I ""hacked"" the school, I have been very interested in how people do actual hacks and have tried multiple scripts on personal computers, BUT NEVER ON THE SCHOOL NETWORK. One of the usbs they checked had ncat for windows on it and a rootkit script on it. They have since then told me that I am not able to use my personal computer unless I use windows and reformat the Linux partition or use one the school loaned Pentium computers.

This is the most stupid thing I have ever heard, but they will hear none of the legitimate reasons people actually use Linux. I am wondering if there are any laws or rights that I can bring up in order to keep using Linux or if there are any methods of disguising Linux as windows in order to keep using it? I live in Australia if that helps with finding laws. Anything would be very much appreciated.

Edit: Thanks Heaps for all the ideas, I really appreciate it, and I'll be sure to update you guys on what happens.

Edit 2: There seems to be a bit of confusion on who owns the computer that I do school work on. The laptop is mine, and they are currently wanting me to use one of there school laptops that has windows installed on it because that means I’m not allowed to install anything on it, it should be free if I did choose to however (I’m not going to though). I am definitely considering just asking to be disconnected from the network instead of changing operating systems since I can just use mobile data.

Edit 3: A bit late, but better than never. The result of this ended up being me given a school laptop instead of allowing me to use mine while at school. Their logic in this was that if another incident were to happen with their system, I would not be less suspicious as I am using a locked down system. This is pretty annoying, but definatly not the worst thing to happen in the world and I am super fortunate that they didn't just suspend me for having crap on my USB.",Can't use Linux? Use BSD.
Does anyone else feel like it's hard to go back to Windows once diving into Linux,"This month I've bought a new laptop to experiment with Linux on a computer rather than a virtual environment, hopped between few distros, started from ubuntu to debian to arch and now i settled with Linux mint. Anyway the laptop has low specs system hardware. 4 gigs of RAM and Intel Celeron n4000 CPU or in other words it's kind of slow with little to no multitasking abilities. 

On my other tower computer that's running Windows 10, I have a fairly powerful hardware and fast speeds (ryzen 7 2700x, gtx 2080ti, 32gb ram) and that's where I do most of my work.

however in this past two weeks I found myself fully relying on the laptop that's running Linux. I have literally abandoned my Windows machine because I felt like Linux is superior, responsive,  intuitive, rich with functionalities, and offers more freedom to the user. I like to see 500mb ram usage after boot up on Linux mint, compared to a whopping 2 GB ram used on a fresh windows 10 install. Also, linux allowed me to enjoy learning computers once again it's so exciting whenever I learn a new feature or command line.","Windows 10 setting/ configuration always throws me into an unreasonable rage. Why the fuck to you have three layers of configurations? The pretty (useless) settings, the ""additional settings"" and MSconfig.

Not to mention the constant updates that change my system settings without warning, breaking the dual boot linux on my system, and the unresponsive login screen that always eats my first keystroke.

Small things, but they add up."
Why does Ubuntu get so much hate?,"I'm a relatively recent linux user (about 4 months) after migrating from Windows. I'm running Ubuntu 24.04 on a Lenovo ThinkPad and have had zero issues this whole time. It was easy to set up, I got all the programs I wanted, did some minor cosmetic adjustments, and its been smooth sailing since.

I was just curious why, when I go on these forums and people ask which distro to use when starting people almost never say Ubuntu? It's almost 100% Mint or some Ubuntu variant but never Ubuntu itself. The most common issue I see cited is snaps, but is that it? Like, no one's forcing you to use snaps.

EDIT: Wow! I posted this and went to bed. I thought I would get like 2 responses and woke up to over 200! Thanks for all the answers, I think I have a better picture of what's going on. Clearly people feel very strongly about this!","Honestly, Ubuntu has just gone in a direction over the years that turns a lot of Linux users off. The whole Snap thing is just the tip of the iceberg. Sure, no one's forcing you to use Snaps – but Canonical is pushing them hard. Some applications are only available as Snaps now, they start slower, don't integrate well with the system, and just feel... wrong compared to native packages.

On top of that, Canonical keeps making decisions that feel completely disconnected from the community. Unity, Mir, Upstart, now Snap – all these were things they tried to push through, only to eventually abandon them. It makes the whole project feel inconsistent. And let's not forget the telemetry they tried to sneak in – even though it's toned down now, that left a bad taste for many users.

Ubuntu increasingly feels like a product, not a free and open system. It's obvious Canonical wants to make money – which is fine – but it comes at the expense of community trust. Distros like Fedora or even Linux Mint just feel more transparent, honest, and user-focused.

Another issue: packages in Ubuntu's official repos are often outdated. If you want up-to-date software, you have to rely on PPAs or Flatpaks, which fragments the system even more. At that point, I might as well use Arch or Manjaro and have it all out of the box.

I'm not saying Ubuntu is bad – it's fine for beginners. But once you want to dig a little deeper, you quickly realize how rigid and bloated it can be. No wonder people tend to recommend Mint, Fedora, or Arch instead."
"Why is MacOS certified Unix system, but Linux is not?",Source: https://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/,"Linux *can* be certified, [it's been done before](https://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3622.htm).  But it costs money, and you have to certify specific releases.  So if redhat certified, it'd be certified for this release, as long as they're using their kernel, etc.  It's worth pointing out that the certification is also a trademark licence, I'm not sure how that plays out with open source.

MacOS was originally certified because [Jobs made the claim that it was UNIX™](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXJsS4B42_Q&t=750s) and then there was [a mad rush to certify](https://www.quora.com/What-goes-into-making-an-OS-to-be-Unix-compliant-certified) when the lawyers smelt blood in the water.  I've actually no idea why it's *still* certified - but I guess once they'd done the work the first time around, it's easier to maintain.

"Windows 11 and its forced ""telemetry"" made me switch to Linux. And I have to say - it's great. So why the hell isn't more people switching? And what's your fav distro?","Took me about a month to find a distro I like. I heard good things about Manjaro, Zorin, Pop, Mint, deepin... Watched like 500 videos, read dozens of articles... So many to choose from.

I first went with Zorin for my Alienware laptop, but it wasn't perfect. Headphones didn't work, spent hours on that, wasn't able to fix. Then I tried to connect my external monitor - no love. 

So I tried Pop and everything just worked right out-of-the-box. Pretty impressive. The bad thing is that after I move all Windows crap from the SSD, I will have to reinstall. And I kinda already made myself at home. :'(

The only thing keeping me from installing it on my main PC are Adobe programs. Man, they really need to start supporting Linux. Not sure why after all those years there's not even an unofficial way to just run them via Wine or whatever it's now called.

Also I can't understand why are people so hesitant to switch to Linux. Feels like there's something I'm missing. 

One question tho - I hear people switching distros from time to time, but how do you keep your stuff? Is it the same like when you upgrade Windows, you just reinstall the system and all your stuff stays?

Oh and one more for people that need to run Windows programs often: how do you do that? Dual boot is just too slow and inconvenient.

Thanks.","People are hesitant to switch to Linux because:

* Common Misconceptions (Thinking Linux is for hackers or programmers)
* Not having a clue that Windows and Mac are not the only operating systems
* Overlooking the flaws of Windows (Many people grew up with Windows and shrug off its flaws as flaws with computing technologies itself)
* Underestimation of volunteers and trust that bigger companies=better products"
"Despite all the warnings not to install kali linux, I decided to install kali linux and I am now encountering an issue I would not face had I chosen to use a linux distro designed with normal desktop use in mind.

After someone asks for me to paste the terminal output, I am going to ignore them instead. 

Here is a video of my problem taken using a shaky camera instead of screen recording, and it also is just as unhelpful to the people trying to help me. I hear youtube is bad, so I posted it on the epic hackerman site odysee.

"Unpopular opinion: don't you think that r/linux is a bit toxic? If you say something (even if it is right and supported by facts) that goes against the ideas of the most of people there, you go in the darkness of downvotes.

The link I posted is just an example, I posted several times in that sub and I noticed this behaviour many times.

It's very sad. If we start fighting even among us who share the same passion for linux, it gets ugly.

The truth should prevail, not extremism.","Yes. Have identical experience. 
However - it’s not just r/Linux but Reddit as a whole. 

People on Reddit tend to upvote what seems to support their (often baseless) believes and misconceptions. Conversely downvote what shakes their (often distorted) view of the world. 
Drawing strength from others supporting the same misconceptions. 

Come to think of it - Reddit is a mirror of the society at large nowadays. Too much information, lots of fakery, emotional manipulation replaces data, people unable to keep up and unwilling/unable to dive deep to separate the fake from facts.

"Should Linux be used more often in education (schools, universities etc.)?","I ask this question because i want to use Linux in my future teaching career, and i need your opinion on this subject.

fyi: i study French and English languages at a teacher training university.

edit: what are the pros and cons of using Linux as a foreign language teacher?","I think Linux should actually be taught in school instead of Microsoft Windows and its software. Linux should be used by everyone for everything, not to just power servers and in IT circles. People use Linux on their smartphones (i mean Android phones), but i think we should focus more on Linux computer usage."
Do you have somebody IRL to talk Linux with?,"I just got a thinkpad and yesterday I installed arch (which is nothing special), but I managed to get it to boot with efistub, signed unified image/secure boot, luks/lvm etc.

When the smart card-thing worked I got quite exited, but couldn’t really share the excitement..

Honest question : Are people seriously moving from Windows to Linux ?,"As windows revealed Copilot + PC 🖥️ . i have been getting so many videos on my YouTube feed about people sharing their thought on moving to linux, some of them are also sharing experiences as well.

It seems like general windows users are threatened by a Recall feature and want to move away from window or is it only me getting all these feed due to searching related linux everyday 🤔 ?

What are your experience ?

----------------- Update : 23 Sep, 2024

Got so many comments and discussion points, I didn't expect that! Thank you all for taking the time. The initial response was mixed, with many people saying they wouldn't move to Linux so easily due to years of habit with Windows and other reasons. However, I also received many comments from people who have switched to Linux for various reasons, not just because of Copilot.","The average person I talk to is so completely oblivious about privacy, I can tell you for a fact that the increase in Linux numbers will be marginal at best."
"I slept under a rock in the last few years, what's the matter with Ubuntu? Seemingly everyone recommends against it now.","Basically title.

A few years prior everyone recommended Ubuntu, and now it's the polar opposite. Please anyone elaborate happened? (I only used Ubuntu on a surface level before.)","There are three main reasons it started getting a lot of hate.

1. Snaps.  This whole thread is full of people elaborating on this.  In summary, they don't align with FOSS ideology and it triggers the community from a software design ethics standpoint.  From an end user standpoint, they aren't usually a huge deal.  Snaps have been known to run a little slower than native installs, plus they run in a somewhat ""quarantined"" environment that limits what the apps can access on your system.  In practice (at least in my experience) this can result in, for example, the Firefox Snap not being able to download files directly to a secondary hard drive.  That leads to the second reason people are outraged by Ubuntu's implementation of Snaps; Firefox is actually ""forced"" into a Snap install on Ubuntu.  One used to be able to uninstall the Firefox Snap and use ""apt install firefox"" to use a native install, until Ubuntu actually made that a shortcut to install the Snap anyway.  This took away user choice, and no one has trusted Ubuntu with Snaps ever since.
2. GNOME 3.  When GNOME completely changed its interface between version 2 to the more macOS-like interface of GNOME 3, a lot of people really hated it.  It's pretty easy to just use a different DE, but since Ubuntu by default prefers GNOME 3 it was a divisive change.
3. Telemetry.  Linux users hate Windows for having telemetry that it reports back to Microsoft about your personal system information.  Ubuntu added telemetry with an easy opt-out option, and a lot of people never forgave them for it.

I personally left Ubuntu when the latest version update killed AppArmor, which also killed Snaps since they inherently rely on it.  It was just enough of an inconvenience to push me away from Ubuntu's promotion of Snaps, but I'm also not in the group that would deter anyone from using Ubuntu just because Snaps.  For the most part, my Ubuntu install was one of the most stable I've had until the borked version update.  I migrated my server to Debian for stability, and migrated my desktop to Mint since it's basically Ubuntu with Cinnamon and no baked-in Snaps."
Is it a good idea to make Linux my daughter's first and only OS to experience?,"As title says, I have a daughter and she's getting into the age when she starts using computers.

Is it a good idea to expose her to Linux only (beginner distro ofc), or should I show her Windows as well? I mean, Linux is clearly better and without corporate bullshitery, but I feel like she should have the same general overview as I did when I switched from Windows I grew up on, to Linux.

Plus, most schools over here teach on Windows only and therefore I fear that not showing her the ropes for it would disadvantage her, same with MS Office being taught vs. Libreoffice she'd use.

On the other hand, I want her to learn Linux well enough to discover the benefits for herself and be able to use it going forward in life, not just because I told her to. And teaching two OSes at roughly the same time would mean she'd learn both more slowly.

Also, teaching both would be harder because either she'd use two computers (not that great of an idea for many reasons), she'd dualboot and I'd live in constant fear of Windows corrupting the boot partition for shits and giggles, or virtualise and make Windows abhorrently slow.",Start Linux then let them learn Windows when they get to school. They'll be worlds ahead of the curve. Don't hard block windows just don't make it available until you have to.
Why is there still no native Notepad++ for Linux? Is anyone else wishing for it?,"I've found alternatives to almost everything I used on Windows, there's one program I still really miss: Notepad++.  
I know you can run it with Wine, and there are other editors like Kate, Geany, or VS Code… but Notepad++ just feels better. It’s super fast and has great plugins. Honestly, it’s the only program that still makes me think about using Windows sometimes.  
Why hasn’t there been a serious push for a native Linux port? Is it just technical debt from being based on Win32, or lack of interest from the maintainers?","Which features make Notepad++ stand out from the rest? 


If you search for a direct cross-platform replacement, you could have a look at Notepad-- (https://github.com/cxasm/notepad--). It's a reimplementation of Notepad++ that was started by some Chinese after the maintainer of Notepad++ openly supported the freedom movement in Hong Kong (what the Notepad-- authors call ""misguided remarks""). Functionality wise, it already came quite far and it's open source, but its political origins leave somewhat of a taste."

I am going to dewindows my company,"First of all: It's not a very big company, less than 10 people actively working for me.

Right now we don't we really have any specific hardware besides our mobile devices are exclusively iPhones for simplicitys sake.

The goal is to have sameish hardware (most likely Thinkpads) but the same software solutions so I can help my people fast and effective, if something unforeseen happens.

Because of the tool package we need for our work (insurance broker) we use M365-E-Mail services. Right now I am only using the browser version of Outlook, but ideally I'd want to provide a desktop application for everyone that can at least run M365-mails and ideally the M365-calender.   
  
Is there anything that ""just works"" if I give it to the average office worker?

Right now I am not sure which Distro I should go for. Ideally I'd want everyone to use KDE Plasma, so I was looking at Fedora KDE - or has anyone a better idea?

Most of our workflow happens in browsers. The very few windows-exclusive software we encounter in our day2day workflow will most likely be usable with wine/bottles or whatever.

Also: Is there a solution where the user is able to update the system but nothing else? No root access or anything.

I know there probably won't be THE perfect solution but I'd be happy to hear everyones opinion and tips, so I can provide my workes with the objectively better OS asap.","Hi, IT professional here. This is something you should do overtime. Something like 6 months to up-to a year.

First step is making a list of all the software you use, ask your employees to record a list of software they use. Ask them to make a note of this over time. Since it's common for people to have software they don't know or remember.

Second, migrate to new software using the windows version of that software. For example if they use Microsoft office, ask them to try OnlyOffice. Getting them on software that is cross platform before the switch will improve the transition. But also allows them to fallback to their old software if there's a problem.

Once you feel confident that replacements exist for all of your business functions, you can start the roll over. Try to find employees who have good replacements and are ideally excited about the operating system and experimentation. Have something 2 of them make the switch. They can gain experience of resolving any issues and using the software and/or hardware.

If they've successfully switched, then you can bring more on board, like another 2. Again, building your team's knowledge overtime, slowly.

Most likely you'll get to a point where 7-8 on onboard but a few left who are using specific software that doesn't have good alternatives.  You can decide then how you might want to proceed, most likely you'll need some type of mixed system for awhile, or have dedicated windows machines for specific functions.

Also, consider supporting a company like System76 if your existing machines have support issues. They have some pretty cheap workstations which come with Linux preinstalled.

The basic idea is being knowledgeable about what you're using, who's going to be difficult to transition and who will be easy. Who's excited about a change like this and who isn't. Consider the comfort level for your employees. Have multiple steps which are good exit or delay points for troubleshooting."
I unintentionally deleted my entire OS,"I can’t explain why, but I ran ```sudo rm -rf /*``` on my laptop and deleted every file. There is nothing super vital, but it would be nice to recover my schoolwork and other various documents.

How should I go about recovering everything? What live environment should I use? What commands? Is it possible to restore the entire OS or just recover some of the files?","Yeah I would recommend you avoid doing that again in the future.

What is your main reason for using Linux?","I started with Linux in 1994.  Back then it was about programming IRC scripts to take advantage of netsplits to take over communications channels in well established chat rooms (#hottub TAKOVER!)

I wanted to get a job in Linux but there wasn't any when I got out of college.  So I waited.  Eventually, Linux began to creep into the enterprise and for every single project surrounding it, I volunteered.  Soon, I was running every Linux server and project that came about.

A few years later, I became a developer for one of the major distributions of Linux that was in the top 5 at distrowatch.  I burned the candle at both ends and stepped away when I had TOO much Linux.

Meanwhile, I continued to progress in my professional life...starting to work with Linux VM's, containers, grepping logs for traceID's, rolling apps into Rancher/K3's.  By this time, I had been using Linux for 20 years and was generally head and shoulders above most people with it.

Now, I am a senior devops engineer with a major company and I run Mac/Linux for just about everything I do...including personal life.

I don't know where I'd be without that first accidental join to # in IRC...where they had removed a password to join for a fleeting few minutes and some rando newbie with a sharp tongue joined them.  I owe everything to those random hackers that befriended me and sent me down the rabbit hole.

I use Linux because it's part of my profession...but more because it's part of my life."

Also phones typically use ARM SoCs which are not as standardized as x86 or x86-64 desktop CPUs

btw.

"Valve said they are working with EAC and BattlEye to bring anti-cheat to Linux gaming.

How will this be reconciled with Linux? I read that EAC is already available on Linux for native games, so we must have some information about this. Does anyone have an idea on how it works, and whether it introduces a similar security flaw?","Have you thought this could be a feature exclussive to SteamOS or even Steam Deck?

Anti-cheat is invasive by design. They have to take control of your computer to ensure you're not doing what you want with it."
Help! My friend can't stop reinstalling Arch Linux,"My friend has this borderline addiction to reinstalling Arch Linux. Anytime there's real work to be done, he’s nuking his system and starting over—it's like an OCD thing. He does it at least 5 times a week, sometimes daily. It's gotten to the point where he's reinstalled Arch nearly 365 times last year. I have no clue how to confront him about it.","He is using arch the right way. I, too, install my system from scratch everyday first thing in the morning and nuke it before sleep so it can be clean from any sin."
This sub became just useless,"I miss the time where people actually asked about Linux specific problems or help.

Now it's just... ""which distro for _____?"" posts, with either nonsense context, where one might ask themselves if the OP is just karma-whoring (or a bot), or about something that has already been asked a zillion times over the past few weeks, and could easily be searched for.

So long, bots!

Edit: I wasn't complaining about questions that could be looked up, but exclusively about ""which distro"" questions for literally nonsense reasons. Like ""which distro has the most customizability"".","That's the case almost everywhere now. Not just on Reddit.

People want to have everything handed to them on a silver platter without having to do anything themselves (such as using a search engine or the search function on platforms like Reddit).

But the problem is also that people get away with it. 

For example, when I point people to http://catb.org/%7Eesr/faqs/smart-questions.html, it's often not just the person asking for help who complains, but other users too. 

Because I have to understand that a beginner is not able to ask questions correctly because they are a beginner. I think that's nonsense. Yes, beginners often lack knowledge. But they can, for example, state the exact wording of an error message. They can specify the distribution used. And they can tell what they have already tried to solve the problem themselves. But they usually don't do it. But not because they are too stupid, but usually just too lazy. 

For example, the last time I asked for help on another platform, I spent about 20 minutes creating and improving a post before I posted it. Even though I had almost no knowledge of the topic in question. I was a newbie, so to speak. And within a few hours I received an answer with which I was able to solve the problem.

How can this problem be solved? Probably not at all on Reddit. Since you can create a new user account at any time, a user account is worth nothing these days. Therefore, as a user, you can basically do whatever you want. Like not asking smart questions and ignoring other rules."
Why C++ wasn’t used for the Linux kernel before Rust was created?,"From my understanding one of the things that Rust brings is safety, but while C++ is not the best choice in that regard, it brings a few things like constructors and destructors and unique and shared pointers that help quite a lot versus C. 
C++ is a language backcompable with C I don’t understand why this switch didn’t happen and happens now with Rust.

Where can I do so to ensure that the only recipients of the funds go to the devs who are working on it day-to-day, month-to-month, year-over-year?

Ty!","You don’t need to donate to Linux as an individual as most of its development is funded by major companies that rely on it. But if you just really really want to support the ecosystem, the best place is the Linux Foundation.

What are the top 5 linux NO NOs you have learned over the years of using linux?,"I removed python 3.9 cause I wanted to install manually (from website) python 3.10.  
While python was removed, I rebooted the machine and it was game over.

The login screen was there, but I could not log in. Ttys were ok, so its mainly the graphics that were affected. I googled for a fix, but there were too many comments saying ""a fresh install would be the best choice"".

Beside the famous rm -rf /, what are other huge mistakes every linux user should avoid?","Do not touch `dd` if you don't know how to use it or if you are not careful. If you mistype a single letter (`/dev/sda` vs. `/dev/sdb`), it will happily wipe your drive without asking for confirmation.

Don't interrupt updates. If a critical library like glibc gets updated and then you abort the update, most programs just outright stop working and you are left with no option but to manually perform a very advanced recovery from a live cd.

Don't run random commands from the internet if you don't know what they are going to do. It is not hard to conceal a harmful command or to create a command that looks harmless but isn't.

Be careful when typing commands. When explaining to my friend how to clear the cache for his user on Linux, I told him to run `rm -r ~/.cache`. Instead, he ran `rm -r ~/ .cache`. Notice the difference? There is a space between `~/` and `.cache`. To an inexperienced user, that may seem insignificant, but the first command says to delete the `.cache` folder within the home directory, while the second says to delete the home directory _and_ the `.cache` folder in the _current_ directory. This caused him to lose all his user's files.

If a command fails with `Permission Denied` and you don't know what it does, don't just run it with `sudo`. While it may be harmless, root privileges literally allow you to do _anything_, which means whenever you run something with `sudo`, it has access to your entire system and even your hardware in many cases, so be careful when running commands as root."

Why is Wayland a big deal?,I dont know too much about what Xorg or Wayland really are but I always heard about Wayland being the next big thing for Linux and I wanted to know what it is and what the benefits are kind of a noob when it comes to this part of linux,"Wayland is a simple library that allows desktop environments to integrate the Display Server, Compositor and Window Manager into a single binary. This provides excellent performance and provides a very smooth presentation to the user with minimal resource requirements (no need to send data between different binaries, ect)

X11 (Most popular implementation is Xorg) is an old protocol that was originally designed for running on a PC the size of a room and sending display data over a slow network to a remote terminal back in the 80s. Because of the small initial scope of X11, it was never designed with the idea of a local connection or multiple monitors at different resolutions with different refresh rates. Because of this, extensions were required to allow users to gain those functionalities (xrandr and xinerama).

Nowadays a typical setup for Xorg looks like the following: An X11 display server, An X11 window manager running as a client (same as firefox or any other app would) and an X11 compositor. All of these components have to communicate to each other though IPC (IPC is not designed for graphic usage) and X11 (keep in mind X11 is a protocol designed for remote NETWORK usage) so because of this there are many performance limitations. So because everything is separated into different running binaries, to do very simple small things will require all 3 of these binaries to communicate to each other very frequently using very ill suited/old methods thus causes poor performance.

There is also the side note of security. By design, all Wayland clients CANNOT see each other or have access to the input devices (keyboard, mouse) without having focus on it. X11 on the other hand does not have such limitations, allowing applications to snoop on your activities regardless of if they're in focus or not. A by product of this is poor keybind support for applications, as they cannot see your inputs without being focused."
Why is linux user base so combative?,"Genuinely curious.
What is it “in a general manner” that makes the linux user base so combative and mean in general discussion and user forums?

"Linux machine goes into bootloop every year in december, comes back after New Year","\[RESOLVED\]

I managed to get this resolved. Sadly, it is completely anticlimactic and not at all the fancy, whimsical issue I was hoping to delight you all with. Nevertheless, I am truly grateful for all the help I have received here. Thank you!  
**tldr:** it was a cronjob, but not one in the OS, in the zyxel software, and it was misbehaving;

**Longer version:** I went all ""10 second tom"" on ita nd dug through the files, seconds at a time. Mostly everybody pointed at a job/scheduler thing - so when I was digging through /tmp a file named  scheduler.log stood out. crawling through through it I found references to a zyxel utility (`/usr/bin/zydbcli`). Called it and got a help screen. Then called `/usr/bin/zydbcli --queryschall`   
and low and behold, there was a job in there to reboot the nas every first Tuesday of the month at 8:00 am. Which fiit the bill, since it went into a boot loop yesterday. Removed that using the same utility, and the boot loop has stopped, effectively resolving the issue. Again, this does not show up in crontab (for any user) so I'm writing this off as an issue with zyxel's software, and will sotp wasting everybody's time.  
Again, many, many thanks!

Original post >>>

Yes, you read that right. Every year, in December, my small linux box goes into a continous boot loop. Sometime after New Year it will start working normally like nothing ever happenned.

Ok, now let me give you a little background. I'm a developer, so I have a technical background but sysadmin stuff is not my strong suit. This is a Zyxel NSA320 NAS which, after installing some package from its interface is now also running some minimalistic linux. I get command line access (ssh) and have transmission and minidlna running on it - nothing more. It's basically a torrentbox/mediacenter.

What I found is that it is actually accessible via ssh for a few seconds before rebooting. 5-10 seconds at most. So I could potentially run predefined command or script on it and get its output.

First time it happenned, I almost wrote it off as broken until it just started working again. This is now the 4th year it's doing this - and I figured why not, this is an odd enough thing, somebody might actually enjoy troubleshooting this (I know I will).I've tried the usual poweroff, completely unplug, even disconnected from the network entirely, re-seated the HDD inside (out of desperation). To no availa, when december comes, it goes on vacation.

I'm at a loss here - don't even know where to start. Is anybody kind enough or curious enough to give this a try?

Why does checking a wrong password take longer than accepting the right password?,"During login, or when using sudo my password usually gets accepted instantly, if I type it correctly. If I type in a wrong password though, my PC will take 1-2 seconds until it says it's wrong.

Why is that?","The delay is deliberately added by the underlying PAM module that's doing the password check to make it harder to brute-force login attempts.

It would be nice to not have the delay on a GUI login, and to provide some other rate-limiting tactic (e.g. a 10 second timeout every three invalid password attempts)... but unfortunately that's not how it works.

----
**Edit**: Looking in to this a bit further... a GUI login manager (e.g. GDM or SDDM) _could_ override the standard PAM failure delay logic and handle the delay itself in some ""smarter"" fashion. PAM allows the application to register its own delay function by [setting the `PAM_FAIL_DELAY` PAM item](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pam_fail_delay.3.html)."
Do you really hate Windows that much?,"I know this is a strange question to ask on this sub, given that everywere you can find linux users you also can read  ""windows sucks, finally free from windblows ect.."", but stick with me for a moment.

I'm a farely new linux user, I've been distro hopping from july and settled on manjaro KDE for more than two months now and I love everything about Linux, even the fact that sometimes things just don't work and I can have some fun thinkering and fixing problems.

I dual boot, so I still use windows 10 from time to time. There is no particular problem regarding Windows that made me switch to Linux though: one day I woke up and had nothing to do so I thought it would be cool to try something new with my computer, so I did and discorvered an awesome world and liked it so much that I stayed.

Windows 10 worked just fine on my pc, never had any problems (beside one time when I turned on my laptop only to descover that my OS was broken and there was nothing I could do about it, but still...) and I'm sure that, besides all the unwanted software that it comes with and other things that you can modify to make the OS function better, there surely is some good in it!

I personally like windows and still do and, even if this is difficult to admit, I even switched from Chrome to the new Edge when it came out cause it worked better, at least on my system.

Remember, I'm not trying to say windows is better, because imo it's not and I use Linux for everything that it's not Netflix/Prime (untill they let us have HD streaming) and some games that are not yet available on Linux, but I still can't understand where all this hate comes from.  


So what are your thoughts about this? What made you switch from Windows to Linux? Are you part of the ""Burn Microsoft to the ground"" movement?

Let me know, I'm eager to know your opinion!

Edit: grammar and sintax","Well, long story short on why Linux community hates Microsoft/Windows: They've been trying to kill Linux for almost 30 years.

Blamer (MS CEO) called Open Source and Linux a Cancer and there whole lot more to the story.

Personally, I was just pissed my hibernated PC was waking up for updates, failing them and just hanging there... Also, I got 32inch monitor and sleep in the same room, disturbed my sleep way too often. This is how Windows got to go."
"What exactly is a ""file""?","I have been using linux for 10 months now after using windows for my entire life.

In the beginning, I thought that files are just what programs use e.g. Notepad (.txt), Photoshop etc and the extension of the file will define its purpose. Like I couldn't open a video in a paint file

Once I started using Linux, I began to realise that the purpose of files is not defined by their extension, and its the program that decides how to read a file.

For example I can use Node to run .js files but when I removed the extension it still continued to work

Extensions are basically only for semantic purposes it seems, but arent really required

When I switched from Ubuntu to Arch, having to manually setup my partitions during the installation I took notice of how my volumes e.g. /dev/sda were also *just files*, I tried opening them in neovim only to see nothing inside. 

But somehow that emptiness stores the information required for my file systems

In linux literally everything is a file, it seems. Files store some metadata like creation date, permissions, etc.

This makes me feel like a file can be thought of as an HTML document, where the <head> contains all the metadata of the file and the <body> is what we see when we open it with a text editor, would this be a correct way to think about them?

Is there anything in linux that is *not* a file? 

If everything is a file, then to run those files we need some sort of executable (compiler etc.) which in itself will be a file. There needs to be some sort of ""initial file"" that will be loaded which allows us to load the next file and so on to get the system booted. (e.g. a the ""spark"" which causes the ""explosion"")

How can this initial file be run if there is no files loaded before this file? Would this mean the CPU is able to execute the file directly on raw metal or what? I just cant believe that in linux literally everything is a file. I wonder if Windows is the same, is this fundamentally how operating systems work?

In the context of the HTML example what would a binary file look like? I always thought if I opened a binary file I would see 01011010, but I don't. What the heck is a file?",[**Everything is a file**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file) but note how not every file is really a [**physical file**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file).
Linux is too... good?,"In trying to learn ""linux"", I basically just picked a distro and switched to it cold turkey which after the initial learning curve has been a great choice. I chose Manjaro with i3 , which has forced me to become reasonably proficient at using the terminal and writing small bash scripts, and pacman seems pretty chilled, although I have mostly just memorized commands and what they do.

My problem is that everything works to well. Nothing is breaking and my learning seems to have stagnated a bit. Although I'm loving using manjaro and I have defintely joined the church of i3, what should be the next step in my linux journey?

Why on Linux you don't need to install drivers?,"Compared to Windows, where I need a driver for every piece of hardware like chipset, wifi, audio, etc. How come on Linux I only need GPU driver at most? In my understanding manufacturers always put Linux compatability as an afterthought","In Linux drivers are part of the kernel. That was in fact the usual case before windows came up. Communicating with the hardware is one of the core features of an operating system, and therefore it was considered the job of the OS manufacturer to program the drivers. If a hardware manufacturer wanted to have its hardware running under a certain OS, he would have to provide the OS manufacturer with the details required to write the drivers. Every Unix worked that way, MacOS too. Until Microsoft decided it was a good idea to let the hardware manufacturer write the drivers themselves and provided APIs in MS DOS and windows for this.

This is in fact a horrible idea, since you essentially give away control over essential parts of the OS to an unknown third party. Malicious drivers have been a security problem in windows ever since, even though MS tried to fix it with the requirement of signed drivers.

In Linux, hardware drivers are mostly part of the kernel. Nvidia drivers are a well-known and highly debated exception. Of the many many hardware versions on the market, many are just variations of the same reference design and all run with the same driver. Still, drivers now make up for far more than half of the kernel code, which indicates exactly what you describe."

"I want Linux from Windows as soon as I wake up, spent hours over the past days reading and watching videos about various Linux distros and have found 4 that might suit me.

I apologize for the beginner questions.

&nbsp;

Been using only windows since Windows 95. I'm hoping to move to Linux because I'd like to reduce data mining, increase privacy and get away from big tech, with the hopes that I could still keep the functionality I'm used to & I'm tired of windows breaking. 

This is what I currently use my PC for every day: LibreOffice, E-mails (Thunderbird portable), calendar, listening to music, Bitwarden, reading (Firefox), watching movies (Smplayer), privacy/security (Adguard), TeamViewer (to help my elderly mother who lives very far away).


&nbsp;

I value a friendly community, large user base (who has probably encountered problems I run into, so I can learn from their solutions or ask for advice), stability, ability to configure GUI, dark theme (my eyes are very sensitive), large selection of all sorts of customization, easy to use GUI.

    Hardware

At the moment the latest Windows 10 update broke my system again, I somehow got it working, but I don't know how long it will work and if I can fix it up again. I want to pick a distro asap & install it tomorrow when I get up. Money is tight, so if at all possible, I'd like to save the 80 € that it would cost to fix my pc with diagnostics & Windows 10 in a repair shop if my skills aren't enough. 

So these are the distros I found (note, all the info I post below I found online, on websites, YouTube, forums & I am very much aware that I can be wrong about these points, so please correct me if I am wrong). 

    Zorin
    + looks modern out of the box
    + easy to use
    + new drivers included
    + better software selection included
    + big community 
    + big development team 
    - could be more functional 
    - not very customizable (in comparison to mint)
    - got caught data mining IPs without disclosing it while claiming to respect privacy (major concern for me) 
    - ultimate edition costs money (I don't mind paying for software, it just feels off to me, considering Linux is open source, not a big deal in total)
    - I found a few people having performance issues on Zorin (that they didn't have on other Linux distros) - should this be something to worry about? 
    
    Mint
    + reliable 
    + very functional 
    + very customizable 
    + big community 
    + big development team 
    + very customizable 
    + free
    - looks dated 
    - could be more user-friendly 
    
    Feren 
    + looks modern out of the box
    + easy to use
    + free
    - small development team (1 developer?) - I'm afraid that 
    
    Pop-os
    + looks modern
    + free
    + well funded development 
    - while it looks modern, it looks a bit alien to me (coming from Windows)

**Please help me pick one that suits me the best in your opinion.** 

1. If you think that I should know anything before picking any of these distros please share your know how. 

2. If you think that I should use a different distro instead, please guide me (and if possible, briefly mention why). 


Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I know this text was long. I tried to make it as short as possible, while giving all the needed details. If you happen to know any info, even about one of those distros or my questions, please comment! CHeers :)","First off, huge thanks for doing your own research and writing up such a detailed post! This helps a lot to pick out a suitable distro for you.

A friendly and large community naturally is Ubuntu's kind of thing, so you might want to look towards that direction.


 Stability means you definitely want to look over to the point release distros, so let's say Ubuntu, Ubuntu based distros like Linux Mint. A point release distro usually makes a big release around every 6 months, and a ""rolling"" release distro will constantly release new, up to date packages. Point release results in better stability and a ""just works"" experience, while rolling release is in general less stable, but also gets the latest and newest things which may or may not break.


The ability to configure GUI depends on the desktop environment, not distro. I'd point you towards the KDE Plasma desktop environment, but I see you have an Nvidia card. Nvidia cards aren't really known to work the best with Linux, and KDE Plasma is probably the biggest example of this kind of thing. The animations lag, the desktop environment feels sluggish, you name it. One moment it feels butter smooth, and the next it grinds down to a halt and makes you feel like you're on a 2005 PC with how slow it can appear. You can definitely still try it though, your mileage may vary, as I hear people having no issues with it. I personally really enjoy GNOME (the desktop environment that looks ""alien"" to you), but I must say that it's customizability isn't all that impressive. If you do want to try GNOME sometime, keep in mind that it's a keyboard focused desktop environment. You can definitely comfortably use it with a mouse, though. So for you, you might want to look into desktop environments like XFCE(lightweight DE, doesn't look the flashiest, but it can definitely be made to look quite modern and sleek with some customizations.) or Cinnamon(developed by the Linux Mint team, praised for how intuitive it is for transitioning Windows users). As for your dark theme, pretty much any desktop environment has support for that.


Now for your current distro choices:


Zorin could be nice. But really, I think there are better options, it doesn't seem to do anything better than other distros..



Linux Mint is a phenomenal choice for new Linux users. All your upsides are pretty much spot on. The dated looks can always be changed with a theme, and as for the user friendliness, I don't agree. It's based on Ubuntu which naturally is the most supported and documented distro. It seems to tick almost all of your boxes, I personally love this distro. Has the best support for Cinnamon, since it's developed by the very same team. 




Feren, I don't hear much about it, can't give a solid opinion.



POP_OS is another amazing distro for newcomers. It's Ubuntu based just like Mint, so it has the same user friendliness upsides. As for the alien interface, I can share some thoughts on that. When I came from Windows, I absolutely despised GNOME. Now, it's my favorite desktop environment just because it looks so sleek and simply works well with my Nvidia setup. GNOME has modifications called extensions which you can easily get off the internet with a browser extension. Those modifications include a Dash to Dock reminiscent of MacOS, a panel mode extension(essentially converts GNOME to a Windows-like interface), and for example the current weather on your top bar. Definitely worth a look! If it means anything, Pop OS by far has the best Nvidia support right out of the box.



All your choices are pretty much good. I personally believe the best 3 distros for newcomers are Ubuntu(a lot of hate it gets is stuck in the past, none of the past controversies will affect your experience), Linux Mint and Pop OS. You literally can't go wrong with any of those 3. :)"
why people still use x11,"# I new to Linux world and I see a lot of YouTube videos say that Wayland is better and otherwise people still use X11. I see it in Unix porn, a lot of people use i3. Why is that? The same thing with Btrfs.

Edit: Many thanks to everyone who added a comment.  
Feel free to comment after that edit I will read all comments

Now I know that anything new in the Linux world is not meant to be better in the early stage of development or later in some cases 😂

some apps don't support Wayland at all, and NVIDIA have daddy issues with Linux users 😂

Btrfs is useful when you use its features.

I won't know all that because I am not a heavy Linux user. I use it for fun and learning sysadmin, and I have an AMD GPU. When I try Wayland and Btrfs, it works good. I didn't face anything from the things I saw in the comments.","X11 still works more stably than Wayland, and has network transparency features Wayland designed out of itself.  I can run X11 applications on any X11-capable computer, and use them from any other X11-capable computer over the network.  Some of us still value that capability, though not everyone.

Wayland's advantages have mostly to do with video performance and elimination of video artifacts, and some people see those as must-have features.  For those of us who don't care about those features, though, there is literally no reason to switch from X11 to Wayland.

That having been said, we all might be forced to adopt Wayland eventually, anyway, if Xorg (the dominant X11 implementation for Linux) falls into disrepair due to a lack of developer attention.  We will see.

I'm keeping one eye on Wayland in case I have to switch to it someday, but in the meantime I'm quite happy with X11."

# Here Are My Thoughts About Linux (Mint + XFCE)


## Pros ----------

- It's Waay faster than Windows.

- Installations are quite pleasant and aren't cumbersome like windows.

- Most of the Software I need is already available. (JDK, Python, GCC).

- Faster Compile Times in Java/Haskell, Go, C/C++ and Rust

- Automatically Detects Dependencies so if you don't have some prerequisites of an application fulfilled, it resolves it.

## Cons ----------

- I have to enter my password for everything, I mean EVERYTHING.",">Cons ----------  
>  
>I have to enter my password for everything, I mean EVERYTHING.

Another way to look at this is, Do you really want to do what you think you want to do?

Meaning, the asking for a password allows you time to make sure you're doing the right thing.

As others have said, you'll get used to it and in due time appreciate that it's there."
"Realistically, do you think the day will ever come when Linux is as universally supported by software/hardware developers as Windows/macOS?",I’m kind of a Linux casual but I feel like this is the only reason Linux isn’t the clear and obvious choice for everyone. This is particularly true for professionals who often have to use specialized proprietary equipment. Ie. A musician using a midi drum machine or a scientist using a seismograph in the field need these things to work reliably in the field.,"Linux pretty much owns the High Performance Computing and Scientific Computing world. It’s extremely popular for embedded devices like routers and Internet of Things.

The big sea change with desktop Linux began with the popularity of distros like Ubuntu that offered well integrated sets of software with an easy to manage interface and ran on a wide variety of consumer grade hardware. Distros like RHEL and CentOS are great in the data center on enterprise quality hardware, but aren’t as well supported on things like laptops.

Many software and game developers outside enterprise computing are now offering Linux versions, which is an extremely positive sign. Linux gaming is becoming more of a thing all the time. With any luck, we’ll continue to see the trend continue."

Why is everything free?,"So I am new to the Linux scene. I recently wiped a Windows laptop and put Ubuntu on it and started playing around with it. The other night I am talking to my GF and I am telling her that the OS was free and I was showing her Libre Office as a Microsoft alternative and it's also free to use. And here she finally asks me ""why is all of this free, why are all of these people creating this and giving it out for free and continuing to develope and support it"". I started to answer until I had to think and say ""I'm actually not sure, because they want to?"". I did some googling and couldnt find anyone laying out even one reason for it. Maybe someone here could spell it out for me.

Edit: Thank you everyone for all of the answers and explanations. It's been very informative and insightful reading the answers and some of the documentations referenced. I'm looking forward to delving further into the world of Linux and it feels nice easing into it with the wonderful community supporting it all. Funny how it was only partially because I frequently work with Linux boxes at work but the big factor is my interest in home automation and wanting to have granular control of how it would work.","Because the future of the human race is more important than a stock dividend.

I hate windows and want to switch to Linux.,"Windows is a terrible OS I want to switch to Linux. I have no former experience with Linux so I'm going to use ubuntu. Ever since I heard of Linux I always wanted to use it. I want to know everything that happens in the OS. To me, it's superior to windows in every way. The only thing that makes me not want to switch is gaming. I've seen proton and wine work perfectly with games without anti-cheat. But anti-cheat games I play a lot like rainbow six siege, Apex legends, and valorant don't seem to work well with Linux. I remember that a windows 10 VM would work with siege but then stopped and I don't have any idea about the other games. So should I really switch?

UPDATE: I did not think I would get this many comments on this post holy. It looks like most people suggest I just dual boot Linux. Also, I realize that in my post I'm praising Linux like it's the second coming of Christ even though I have not even used it yet. I later realize that Linux may not be the best OS ever made that I thought it was but I'm still going to try it out. I mainly just wanted to switch because I like that Linux is open source and I don't like Microsoft knowing what I do. Thanks to everyone that took the time to comment on my post!","Keep a drive or partition for windows and dual boot. You don't have to fully switch, if Linux just doesn't support the stuff you do. Just use windows for the games you play and Linux for everything else."
Is vim not technically a text editor? This question was on my final in my college linux class today and my teacher marked in incorrect. I appreciate the help.,"I can't post a photo to the subreddit, so here is a hosting link  https://litter.catbox.moe/bwr0hi.png 

I looked up ""kwrite"" and while that may be the better of the two answers, (I wouldn't know) we never mentioned it in class. Even if it is the ""better"" answer, shouldn't vim still be acceptable?

Why does everyone hate Ubuntu?,"I'm seeing it everywhere on Linux subs, it works great for me and I have no issues with it, along with great software support. So why does everyone hate on Ubuntu? Is it because of Snaps only?","It's largely personal preference stuff.

I just don't like some of the ways Ubuntu does things so I stick to Debian. It's not that I think Ubuntu is bad and no one should use it. It just doesn't provide me with anything I need or want and it DOES force other things I don't want at all onto me."
What forces you to use Windows?,"If you use Windows or macOS beside Linux, what are the main programs or reasons that forces you to use them in such case? Or do you even have any?","Excel (and it has to be Excel - VBA and binary add-ins etc) and to a lesser degree Word and PowerPoint.

Specific hardware support  - my Polar smartwatch used to connect and then synchronise over USB, but these days it does that over Bluetooth to my phone and only needs the USB to charge. So that used to force me to run Windows but doesn't any more. Some of my networking equipment had Windows specific UIs but these days are largely migrating to web UIs. Logitech Harmony all-in-one remote control is set up and configured via Windows UI. Scanners... I rarely need to scan anything but I rely on a old USB scanner that can be a bit hit and miss on linux.

What would happen if Linus passes away?,"Linus Torvalds is 51 years old, lets imagine he lives up to 80 year old,  therefore he would pass away in 29 years.

Who  would be the one in control of the Linux kernel?","most of the work on the kernel is done through several subsystem maintainer already which Linus trusts a lot  
the stable linux kernel is already managed by Greg Kroah-Hartman, Linus manages the latest git master instead  
the LTS kernels also have their own maintainers

What do you call your computers?,"Do you use your first name, or for instance ""LenovoT14""?","I use something representative of what the box is.

Outside of the home, I use things like srvN.example.com and vmN.example.com. I technically see my home stuff as part of the $location.example.com and end up with say `desktop.$location.example.com` as their FQDN. Some have more than one way to address them, laptops are also on the `fw16.vpn.example.com`.

What are some things on Windows that are missing on Linux?,"Aside from Bloatware and Spyware, you're not clever.","These are very technical and opinionated topics so I expect to get downvoted.

- Docker Desktop for Windows is miles  better than Docker CE on Linux when it comes to buildx support and dealing with insecure repositories and cross platform builds. I still struggle with setting up buildx builders for cross platform builders to this day despite having over 7 years of experience with Docker. Good luck explaining why you'd ever use cross platform builders with buildx to a coworker and how to set them up especially with insecure repositories (all of this just works on Windows).

- In some ways Windows generally has a better driver model than Linux. The Windows Minifilter Driver is more robust (and is freuqnetly the basis for anticheat) than anything on Linux. Linux doesn't have a direct equivalent with modules as it keeps the file system hooks as part of its LSM architecture which is not exported so can't be used by kernel modules.

- Microsoft does proprietary software better. The Linux Kernel team for example is openly hostile towards closed sources and proprietary kernel modules, and the people who maintain projects like glibc are openly hostile to people statically linking against them because it violates the GPL and specifically Stallman's hacker culture (interoperability) beliefs.

- There are some very niche pieces of software like the Windows Phone integration that are miles better than the Linux equivalents (KDE Connect) and allow you to do things like pick up your phone and take calls through the operating system. AFAIK you cannot do this on Linux (you CAN do Text Messages however).

- In many cases there is just one way to do something on windows (e.g. notifications) so there's no beurocracy over whether or not a desktop notification daemon is responsible for doing something like playing audio when a notification is received (This was written for you GNOME maintainers).

- Interoperability when it comes to being able to use the alternative OS. Right now only Windows containers can be run on Windows but Linux containers can be run on both Windows and Linux. This matters if you don't want to deploy Windows VMs and want to build cross platform for Linux and Windows like I have to because of my job. (Visual Studio is very bad with Wine and some thing like nmake fundamentally don't work). It doesn't help that Windows containers are implemented through Hyper-V VMs afaik. (Why can't we have an equivalent that leverages qemu + kvm?)

- The Windows API is generally very stable (much more stable than Linux's). Today you can still write software that is backwards compatible with systems from 25 years ago. Supporting Windows XP is actually trivial in 2025 if you target the right Visual Studio SDK while still getting access to a modern compiler + ABI. For Linux it's a challenge to support something as old as CentOS 7 because the Glibc ABI is constantly changing and ""universal binaries"" with modern toolkits are a challenge here.

- However there's a big con with the above. Modern systems programming languages like go and rust do not support Windows XP so its almost always favorable to write legacy programs (even new software development) in C or C++ if you need to support Windows XP (Something I need to do).

- I don't think that Linux has any easy equivalent to managed GPO, especially remote management and control.

I can probably think of some more, but I think I'm going to get downvoted as it is.

Edit: This thread made me realize I know a lot more about corporate IT than your average redditor but when it comes to corporate IT there are many ""linux"" equivalents, but not really any of them are as user friendly as you'd get with a Windows Server stack.

Edit 2: Thanks for all of the constructive discussion, it's rare to see a thread this lively and not toxic in the reddit linux community. I usually am pretty toxic with the amount of ""what distro should I use"" threads, and this gave me a lot of faith in reddit as a whole."
What makes Linux so good for programming?,"I heard it was, but I would like to know why.

Edit: Thanks for all the replies and support. I've never experienced such a knowledgeable community!","IMHO on Linux it's just so easy and natural to see what goes wrong, either in stuff you wrote yourself or third party software:

 * wondering if it reads the config file or listening on the socket you're expecting: `lsof`
 * WTF is my program just sitting there: `strace`
 * I wonder how the C++ mangling went: `strings`
 * Did I link that correctly: `ldd`
 * so was that file saved in UTF-8 or latin: `od`
 * wait, is it trying to use the proxy or not: `tcpdump`
 * size of memory segments and swap usage: `pmap`
 * and others like `top`/`ntop`/`iotop`, digging around in `/proc/$mypid`, `ps` for showing the env and everything, `dtrace` and `gdb` for super detailled tracing 

Yes you can get all of these on other OS', but you need to find the actual replacement, deal with shitty shareware sites and app stores to download them, and then figure out how they work. Here, most the above tools are a core part of the Unix experience since decades and they are always just a couple of keystrokes away."
What changes did you not expect to happen from switching to Linux?,"TL; DR - My desktop went from a disgusting mess to completely empty.

I switched from using only Windows my whole life to Linux full-time about a year ago, and a big change for me was using a file structure that actually made sense. Basically, I'd spent all of my years participating in the disgusting practice of: 1) Accumulate a bunch of files on your desktop. 2) When your desktop becomes too full, create a New Folder, and throw it all in there. 3) Repeat until you have half a dozen New Folders on your desktop. 4) Create one more New Folder, put all the others inside that. 5) Repeat.

The biggest reason for that was probably just that the file structures didn't make much sense to me on Windows. Yeah, if you opened the file manager, there were Pictures, Videos, etc. on the left, but trying to figure out what was actually going on was weird to me. Had to go to the top level where Program Files and what not were, then Users, then choose my account out of a handful of other options that were there despite me being the only user, then you find the Desktop, Documents, etc., along with a bunch of other folders and files I'd never seen before. Why bother with all that when I can just stay comfy on the Desktop and Downloads folders?

Switching to Linux, I took the time to actually learn the file structures and why most of the directories were there, on root and user levels, and things made sense to me. Like, it makes sense that `/home/kavb333/` is my user's home directory, where my Desktop, Documents, etc. are, and it makes sense that my .config, .cache, etc. would be there, too. Of course the high level user stuff is just at `~/<here>` because that's the home directory. So after I made the switch, I took a day or two out of my time to go through the disgusting war crime I committed over the years to my desktop, and put things into the directories they actually belong, and now my Desktop is almost always empty.","Yes! The file structure on linux feels way more natural, perhaps i just didn't spend enough time learning windows's file structure...

"Buddy just donated a i7 with 64 gigs of ram for my home Linux box running Minecraft, just because I bragged about repairing my 2008 dual-core 8 gig box.","I also told him I was looking for ddr2.

Does anyone know what I can do to fill 64 gigs of ram that is mildly entertaining or better? I don't think Zabbix and another Minecraft server will even make it break a sweat.","ZFS for a large array with online deduplication, an elasticsearch server, or about 5 chrome tabs."
Transfer 50 TB of media the fastest way possible,"Hey folks,

I have 2 linux machines that each have 10G connectivity. I need to transfer 50 TB of media from one to the other and speed is my top priority. It looks like SSH ciphers are my bottleneck so far. I get a maximum of around 120-150 MB/sec using rsync and choosing the aes256-ctr cipher. Both the source and destinations are capable of around 500 MB/sec read/write speeds, and I would love for those speeds to be my bottleneck. Any suggestions?  


Thanks a bunch for your input!

\-Stan","On destination

    netcat -l 4444 | tar x

On source:

    tar c . | netcat <dest-server> 4444

This avoids all protocols, encryption, and handshakes.  It should give you the fastest speed possible given the limits of your hardware and TCP stacks.

UPDATE:

If you're worried about a disconnect, you can run this on the source instead:

    tar c . | netcat <dest-server> 4444; rsync -r . <dest-server>:<dest-dir>

If you think network is a bottleneck (dedicated 10Gb shouldn't be), you can add gzip:

On destination

    netcat -l 4444 | gzip -d | tar x

On source:

    tar c . | gzip | netcat <dest-server> 4444

(Used gzip instead of -z because pipes will make better use of multiple cores and provide more buffering.)"

"How to get ""comfortable"" on Linux?","Hello! I've been using Linux for years now, i know how to use it, how it works etc.. 

And after a lot of distro hopping i've finally stopped and i've been using arch linux for over two years now. 

I like it and all, and i've made it just how i want it, i use it basically as my main OS, but there's a problem: 

I cannot, no matter how much i try, get that ""comfortable feeling"" i had on Windows.

It's not a matter of ""you don't know how to use it"" or ""you're new"" I know how to use it, i've been using it for years, all my machines at home run Arch and my servers run Debian. 

BUT despite all the experience, the customization i've done etc... I just cannot feel ""at home"" 

I seriously don't know how to explain it, but when i go back to windows (maybe for trying some software or what not) i just feel ""better"" it's like getting a breath of fresh air. 

It's like Linux is this ""alien"" OS that i use and works well and all BUT it's not mine despite everything. I don't feel it and don't know how to explain it and why this happens. 

I don't know what to do to get the same feeling that i have on Windows on Linux too; 

despite many years of using it and loving it i just cannot get that feeling.

I don't know if anyone had this weird problem too.","It happened to me without realising. After using Linux in my everyday activities for web browsing, watching movies and programming, and using Windows only for gaming, now I feel at home in Linux and I feel that the restrictive and unfamiliar OS is Windows.

Why are so many tools made for linux rather than other operating systems?,"I have seen numerous networking, scripting,
and cybersecurity tools on Linux that don’t really exist on any other operating system. My question to this is why is that so? Is it because Linux is open-sourced?","I would rather say it is because Linux runs the entire internet (well at least the very most part aprox. 70%?) and therefore creating system hardening and additional security tools for an already solid and by default stable and secure base system sounds logical to me.

"What's limiting Linux from having excellent trackpad drivers, like Macbooks or Microsoft Precision?","I'm a Linux noob and I'm probably not as much as a power user as most Linux users, so I focus a lot more on general usability and user experience.

I'm using Pop on a Surface Laptop 3, and I've noticed the trackpad feels a lot more primitive than it is on Windows. This may be because the hardware is optimised more for Windows, but even when it comes to gesture support beyond 2 finger scrolling, every solution I've found maps gestures to keyboard shortcuts. This is good in a vacuum, but when gestures on Windows and Macs feel a lot better integrated (instead of the scrolling action feeling incremental, the action on-screen directly correlates to your finger movement, down to the smallest movement), it makes me wonder why Linux seems to be so behind in this regard. In order for Linux to truly become a mainstream competitor to Windows and Mac, in my opinion, a competitive trackpad is essential.

This isn't me bashing Linux; I love the UI customisability and genuinely want the adoption of Linux to grow - I'm just curious out of concern; what's limiting the Linux trackpad?","Having to reverse engineer closed source hardware. Microsoft partner with OEM's (and in the case of the surface make their own) while Apple exclusively manufacture their own hardware. Linux for the most part has to make do with what's available and figure out how it works from scratch.

If you're using Wayland Gnome now has some trackpad gesture support with an extension. I've not tried pop but it works well with debian."
Windows 10 has made my laptop unusable. Ready to switch to Linux. Help me choose a distro for newbies.,"Edit: I decided to go with Fedora. I had a bit of trouble, but after resetting my BIOS, it's working just fine now. 

One thing I'm enjoying so far is that my computer is not overheating like it did with Windows. Been playing videos and making video calls. Barely any warmth with a quiet fan now. On Windows 10, my computer would get super hot on the top and bottom with a loud fan. That alone is worth the switch. 

I also retained pinch to zoom functionality for my trackpad which is great. I use that feature a lot. It's what stopped me from switching to Linux years ago when I was considering it. Luckily with Fedora, it still works.

Thanks to everyone who commented to help me. I'm excited to learn more about the wonders of Linux.  




Original: The other night I did an update for Windows 10. I regret it so much. My laptop won't turn on properly. When it finally did load, it ran horribly. 

 I tried to rollback before the updates but the OS is running so shitty, I can even get to the settings to see if there's a rollback available. 

So now I'm like, fuck it. Let's give Linux a try. I tried years ago, but I had issues finding a distro  that let me do pinch and zoom with my trackpad. Now I don't care about that anymore. I need a working laptop with an OS that doesn't terrify me everytime there's an update. I blocked Windows updates for almost 2 years because it fucked up my computer last time. This time is even worse. 


I'm not a computer expert but I can read and follow directions pretty well. I've done things like install custom ROMs on my phones without bricking them. A lil effort to get my tech to work won't scare me. Though I prefer something that's simple to use for newbies. I need to be able to get online and have my camera and mic working properly out the box so I can work. Give me that and I'll figure out the rest as I go.

Laptop Battery Facts of Life,"Readers, I just had an [interesting conversation](https://old.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/mya1uf/pauses_randomly_when_opening_apps_under_any_distro/) with a laptop owner whose laptop is underperforming. During the conversation, this exchange took place:

------------------------------------------------------------

> I don't wanna wear out the battery by plugging it in. 

Ah, okay, now I get it. I hate to tell you this, but here are the facts of battery life:

* Not plugging in your laptop except to recharge the battery **wears out your battery**.

* But plugging in your laptop -- leaving your laptop plugged in most of the time -- **does not wear out your battery**. 

An intelligent laptop battery charger only charges the battery to about 80% *in the long term* (depending on the battery type), then maintains that charge level, neither adding to nor subtracting from the charge level. In the short term the charger provide 100% charge, but over a longer period, this charge level is allowed to decline.

When the laptop is plugged in, when it's in use, *all the power comes from the charger, not the battery*. So the battery, neither being charged nor discharged, has a very long life.

If the laptop is not plugged in when in use, the battery must provide all the operating power, and that power must be replaced periodically. This means the battery is constantly being charged and discharged, *which substantially shortens the battery's life.*

A battery's service lifetime is measured by how many charge/discharge cycles it can tolerate. *If you want to wear out your battery, by all means force it to charge and discharge every day.* The best way to destroy your laptop's battery is to use it without line power, then plug it in and force a recharge, every day.

If you do this, the computer manufacturers will love you, because you'll be replacing your laptops like clockwork, especially now that new-laptop batteries can't even be accessed/removed/replaced any more.

ADDENDUM: This is true for electric cars also:

[Electric car battery life: how to preserve your battery](https://www.drivingelectric.com/your-questions-answered/96/electric-car-battery-life-how-preserve-your-battery) : ""A battery expert on a Tesla forum (with a PhD in electromechanical engineering) recommends keeping your state of charge between 15% and 90%, others 25%-75%, but advice varies. Some say 20%-80%, but fundamentally, the rule is don’t overcharge it or let it go completely flat.""

One may ask what relevance electric car batteries have for laptop batteries. As it turns out, they're the same batteries, just more of them.

Why is Kali Linux so disproportionately popular with absolute beginners to Linux?,"I was someone whose first ever experience with linux was from Kali.

About 6 or so months ago I successfully transitioned to Debian Sid, and everything copied over just fine and it's virtually identical.

I see so many Kali posts on linux subs. For what Kali's use case is, you would think it might be used by one in a thousand linux users. Why are beginners attracted to it?

Open Source alternative to Discord?,Do we have an app that is like Discord but open source and private focus?,"I'd say Riot/Matrix is most likely to have the features you're looking for.

If you're unfamiliar, [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) is the protocol. Basically its goal is to become a superset of the features offered by IRC and XMPP while maintaining the decentralized and open paradigm. Text chat, audio chat, video chat, file sharing, etc.

Since it's an open protocol like IRC, XMPP, HTTP, etc., anyone can create a client. [Riot](https://about.riot.im/) is the client that the Matrix project created themselves and is pretty mature.

There are many Matrix servers out there you can use, or you can create your own server. Again, since it's an open protocol, anyone can create a server, but [Synapse](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/server/synapse) is the server that the Matrix project created themselves.

The Matrix Foundation themselves run their own server that's open to the public. Or, if you want to shop around for other existing servers to find one that matches the ethos you're looking for, take a look at [this list](https://www.hello-matrix.net/public_servers.php).

For interactive use, it is close to 100% compatible with bash syntax, but the interface has various quality of life improvements.
Here are a few:

The main features involve things like tab completion, which zsh can do by picking items from a menu (bash displays the options, but doesn't let you pick one, you just keep typing and try again).

Also tab completion for the beginnings of commands and filenames, rather than only the end.

Also plugins for things like syntax highlighting commands on the fly (if you type in the command name wrong, the syntax highlighting will show you it is the wrong color before you even run it)"
Is AMD better for Linux?,"I love Linux but always run into display issues with my nvidia card. Fractional scaling is borked, theres no wayland support, and I get rendering issues with certain software that causes it to crash. Ironically, gaming is great.

Update - thanks for all the great answers and discussion guys. A fair few pretty technical ones, along with some people wondering if it really is all that bad, and some pointing out that not all distros are equal in this regard. All interesting points and what I was looking for!","It's complicated, but in a nutshell it's because of file locking and dynamically loaded libraries.

Windows can't modify files that are in use.  Linux can.  With Linux, updates can occur in the background while you work on other things.  You can postpone a reboot indefinitely with Linux.  
Windows, otoh, can't modify those files so they have to be stored somewhere and then be applied on the next reboot.   This takes time while the user waits.

Also, Windows is more complicated due to how it evolved.  I won't get into details, but there are a lot of hard dependencies between components and internal binary data stores.  Linux is much simpler.

These 2 things combined are worse then their sum.  The complexity of Windows sometimes requires multiple reboots to fully apply an update.  Plus, since Windows 10, Microsoft has been much more aggressive with pushing updates.  It used to be that you could wait until you were ready, but not if you wait too long, you get an update if you like it or not.

I have generalized some statements above and someone being pedantic could nit-pick what I've written, but in general, this is the problem at a high level."

I work on Linux servers daily.

I always dual-booted Windows for gaming. 

I still run Arch on my home server and we use RHEL on our servers at work.  I use Windows w/ an X server to run konsole and other apps remotely at work.

Point is, I'm not an amateur.  I use Linux daily, just not on the desktop.  I gave up on the desktop years ago because Windows was good enough and was more stable and reliable.  Simpler, even.

Since a lot of time has passed, I was wondering if things have fundamentally improved.  From what I read, it seems like it hasn't, but I thought maybe I was just getting biased information.  

I got a new laptop without a discrete GPU, so there's no reason I couldn't run Linux on it for everything.  It's got a second M.2 slot, so I could buy one and try a Linux desktop again without much trouble.  I just don't want to waste my time if the situation is still as it was in 2013:  ""usable but buggy and inconsistent with no real advantage over Windows.""

edit:  VirtualBox didn't work as well as I'd hoped so I installed Arch after shrinking my Windows partition by 64GB. It's fine so far.  I tried KDE w/Wayland and that was a mistake and waste of an hour.  I've got things set up enough to not be frustrated and am typing this from Firefox in Plasma.  I'll update in a week or two.","I switched back after years on Windows, and I had forgotten how good it is to run Linux on a desktop. It felt like switching from a tablet to a computer.

It still has its annoyances though, so if you're happy enough with Windows, I wouldn't bother."
Why do you use Linux over Windows?,"I've used both Windows and Linux for years and ended up switching to Linux full-time.

Privacy is a very small reason I switched, because I utilize most of Google's services, still. For me, while I do care about privacy, Linux is better for my workflow and updates don't break stuff, like Windows, which is just a total mess, on top of their lack of privacy controls. I simply don't like Windows. The last decent one was 7, but even then...

I'm curious to know why  **you** choose Linux over Windows, but I'm even more curious to hear viewpoints from those who aren't necessarily running Linux for privacy reasons.","I just prefer the Linux-way of seeing things. Everything on the system is a file, not some obscure database that I can only interact with via a closed-source tool. Then there is the modularity.

Replacement for Damn Vulnerable Linux?,"Once upon a time there was a distro called [Damn Vulnerable Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damn_Vulnerable_Linux) that was based on slackware and only available on i486 CPU's and was, well, damn vulnerable.

How to convince by boss that Linux isn't evil?,"Moved from r/linux:

So my boss hates Linux. He thinks it's insecure, ""this strange operating system"", and not what businesses use.

Currently  we have a few embedded IoT type products that use Linux (no GUI).  Recently, he's been obsessed with cyber-security. Recent ransomware  attacks on peer companies have put the fear of god into him. So he's  hired an IT group and because they have almost no experience with Linux,  we support those servers and they support our Windows servers. Most  people in our office use windows, but a few developers use virtual  machines to use Linux and Windows. This is because the developers prefer  Linux, but also we have products to support.

So  far he's refrained some forcing us to use Windows on our laptops  full-time, but he wants to switch all of our embedded products over to  something other than Linux. Apparently one customer didn't want to buy  our product because it used Linux (which they never would have even seen  because configuration is via web browser), so now he's assuming that  customer knows something he doesn't.

Any  tips on convincing him Linux isn't some hobby toy? I just want him to  make decisions based on real information and not his own bias. I doubt  he'll want to listen to me much because he knows I prefer Linux, however  I also use Windows when it's the right tool.","> Recently, he's been obsessed with cyber-security.

Why do YOU specifically use linux.,"I know you've all seen many posts of this nature and are really bored of them, but I just recently dualbooted linux and I've been testing out different distros etc. And i haven't really found a reason for my case specifically to switch over, so I was wondering what do you use linux for and where do you work at etc. It might sound kinda dumb but i have this thing in my mind that tells me most linux users are back end developers that need to have the control over the littlest of things. I just work in game engines and write gameplay related scripts, and just play games in my free time etc. So i haven't found a reason for a person like me to switch over. So i was just wondering in your case what does linux grant you that windows doesn't have.(Not talking about privacy etc.)","You mean outside all the obvious Microsoft stuff, information collecting, snapshots, endless forced tweaks and so on.

I think it's not about microcontrol, that's nice, but about general control. I don't \*have\* to update. I don't \*have\* to buy new unneccessary hardware. I don't have to get x,y or z installed whether I want to or not. Want to get rid of Edge ? Good luck, it's apparently ""required to install stuff"". Why ? Why are there two control panels ? 

Then there's the security, and the reliability. It just works. None of these spectacularly destructive failures, especially on updates. You can change things easily. Stuff is documented. You get the impression the people who wrote these things know how it works, whereas Microsoft is chaotic (read the book ""Showstoppers"", a history of Windows NT). It's quicker, there's no Windows rot.

The granular design. Windows is still a huge lump of stuff, which is why updates are so shambolic. Linux is compartmentalised, library x does one thing or closely related set of things. SDL does game graphics/sound/controllers. You update that, you don't update anything else. None of these composite ""patches"". The chaotic design is why there are so many update fails. Apple avoid it with the other scam, forced upgrades of software and hardware. 

The only reason Windows gets away with it is most of its users don't do anything much with it ; they browse the web, read emails, maybe watch videos, maybe play a few games.

Finally the dumping. You a Silverlight user ? Remember when Microsoft wanted all web apps to be VB Controls in an ActiveX wrapper. Probably you don't. 

But Microsoft will happily sh\*t on customers for benefit. Sometimes it's just sheer nastiness, like I recall IE lost the ability to do scalable vector graphics, which presumably was pushing Silverlight or something. I still have nightmares about trying to get a sound sample to play consistently across browsers. Chrome, Firefox, Opera, no problem. XXXXing Internet Explorer and XXXXing Safari, Microsoft and Apple, lock-in and monetise our speciality, nightmare. Do we support OGG ?, no because we want our format to be the only one so we can license it.

The only reason to stay with Windows is if you are a high level gamer (currently, restrictions on game cheating) or you have an app that won't work virtualised that you need on enough not to dual boot, or some piece of hardware that doesn't work (sometimes you have to go the other way, for older hardware that you can't get modern drivers for).

It will get worse. I'm hoping there's an abandonment of Windows because of the utter scam of the TPM/CPU requirements for Windows 11, supposedly necessary (obvious lie)."
Why is it hard to run android apps on Linux?,"First of all, I know that there are many projects like anbox, and the like that run android apps on Linux.

I am wondering about something else, why haven't anybody ported the Android runtime, and bionics to run on Linux?

Also since google has it running on ChromeOS, how hard can it be to just copy it as a library, and somehow install apks with some flags to find the ART on Linux?

If it is hard to run normal apks, after we compile bionic, and ART, why can't we make some sort of Linux apks that uses those? Or since Apks are just zip files that get compiled to elf with a tool called dex2oat, it might be possible to make our own tool to compile a Linux version.

Is it feasible to switch to Linux as a main OS?,"I had a cybersecurity phase and got into pentesting, so I set up a dual boot with Windows 10 and parrot OS.

My windows OS is so much slower than my Linux distro, it's gotten to the point that unless I'm using something that specifically requires Windows, I only use Linux. 

I timed how long it takes from powering my computer on to having a browser open. On parrot, it takes just over a minute to have logged in and opened Firefox. It takes over 6 minutes for my windows to start and open Chrome. 5 extra minutes i could've been productive or doing something other than waiting, unless my maths is wrong, that's 30 hours a year of staring at ""preparing windows"".

What distro would be the best given my circumstance? I mostly use my laptop for music production and streaming shows, aswell as playing video games occasionally.

The main apps I use:
Steam
FL studio
Chrome (any browser will do)

Is android... Linux..?,"Do you consider it linux or..?

Since everyone is agreeing, I'll say my opinion:if it walks like a dog, eats like a dog and barks like a dog, it's a dog.

 Android is the most distant linux distro, because of it's use of certain tools that are unconventional, wierd standard and architecture.. But it IS linux.

 Just think about it, no matter how far we go from linux, as long as the original linux source code is there, it's still linux with a whole lot of packages. The fact that it's BASED ON linux and works off the original code is enough in my opinion.

```
touch log
echo ERROR > log

&#x200B;

The distro: So i heard about distros, and it seems that they are the diffrent customized versions of linux, well im gonna be doing gaming and emulation (mostly gc/wii and psp which are already avaible) and just gonna use it for daily use so i wanted ask which distro would suit me best, i heard about some of them like pop!os or ubuntu but im not sure which to choose

&#x200B;

The use of terminal: So if im right, the terminal is just a better version of the command line on windows but there seems to be sometimes that you just have to use it i want to know if i could find these thing off the internet or something

&#x200B;

So yeah thats kinda it, if there is any like, apps i could use that'll just be extras  or something it would be great to see those too

THX For your support!","Compatibility: Many games and programs made for Windows can run on Linux using Wine or Proton, but not all of them.

Distro: Two of the more user friendly ones are Pop! OS and Linux Mint (my preferred distro). They are both based on Ubuntu but have desktop environments that are more similar to Windows, especially Linux Mint.

How do I convince my principal to use GNU/Linux instead of ms windows?,"I'm a young computer enthusiast, but I'm very sad because my teachers of school aren't aware about GNU software, they don't have knowledge about the free and open source software, they use Microsoft Windows in school and teach about Microsoft software most of the time, because of this if any student like me have curosity in software development and want to know what is going on behind the scenes, want to change or add something, how will they do that, schools are not teaching about free and open source software.

I then reinstalled Ubuntu without wiping, and without full disk Encryption, but with an extremely long password. And I disabled the BIOS password.

Am I the only person who ends up being unproductive and keeps customizing/trying DE's and WM's? (semi-rant),"I wish I didn't had the knowledge that I can customize a distribution to my heart's content, so I can use WSL2 with Windows and stay productively ignorant writing code.

Snaps: why are they so controversial and how do they affect performance?,"Hello,

This is not at all meant to start a flame war, I’m genuinely wanting to learn here. I’ve seen a number of people mentioning how much they hate Snaps and Snap support - even going so far as to considering leaving distros that support them by default. As a non-advanced user, I’ve found them helpful for certain things. For a media server, they sandbox the files and automatically stay updated. I’m wanting to learn and understand why they are negative.

Secondly, I’m curious about the performance of something installed via a Snap. Again, for a media server, I’ve found that running in Docker can negatively affect ability to transcode and access all threads/core of the processor. I’m curious if running via a Snap also eats up more resources and affects performance since all the files needed are installed in the Snap (even if they are already installed outside of it). I’m wondering if this similarly affects things like transcoding performance, etc as well. 

Any info would be incredibly helpful. I’m trying to learn and understand about Snaps and also figure out why I’m seeing some spikes in CPU usage from a Snap install. Thanks so much in advance!","Snaps follow the pattern of other recent packaging technologies like Appimages and Flatpaks -- these try to break the dependency logjam that has gotten worse over the years. As Linux becomes more complex, a given application's chance to run without coming into conflict with another application's libraries and dependency requirements declines. This leads to something called ""dependency hell"", where it's impossible to launch and run an application without interfering with another application.

Snaps and the others address this issue by packaging all dependencies together with the application in an isolation container, segregating it from the rest of the system. The drawback is that such a package is much larger than an equivalent conventional application that happens not to conflict with any others. Such a container takes up more storage space, takes longer to launch, and in some cases has a peculiar set of interface requirements.

Snaps take this a step further by having a very strict security model that in some cases prevents the isolated application from being able to read the data files it must, or in other cases prevents the application from functioning at all.

Clementine is a media player that tends to be difficult to install because of its many dependencies. So it's now a Snap. One minor problem -- Clementine cannot read the media files it must, in order to be of any use. Why? The Snap security model.

Many organizations want to move their /home directory out of the system root  for various reasons -- some businesses prefer this because it allows them to use ""thin clients"" wired to a central data server that holds all the organization's data. One problem, though -- they cannot do this with Snaps, which won't function if the /home directory is remoted in certain common ways. So either no business users, or no Snaps, and there is no third option.

Canonical is pushing Snaps pretty hard right now, for reasons of their own. Their fervor is such that when a Ubuntu 20.04 user tries to install the Chromium browser, the Apt profile for Chromium merely triggers a switch that tries to install the Snap version of Chromium. The user is given a stark choice -- install the Snap or do without Chromium.

This wrenching of control out of the hands of users rubs a lot of people the wrong way and is causing much discussion about what this augurs for the future of Linux, a future that seems to be drifting away from individual choice toward corporate control over end users.

These and related issues has caused the Linux Mint developers to [remove the Snap system from their offering](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-mint-dumps-ubuntu-snap/).

That's the controversy, in a nutshell."

5. Run other tools like foremost on the `/dev/mapper/cryptroot` device or whatever the unlocked device is.
6. If you can't recover the data you need, then try `extundelete` on a read-write drive. I have had good luck with that.

You should get an external thumb drive or hard drive to write the recovered files to, since you want your drive mounted as read-only.

Good luck."
Is LibreOffice and/or OnlyOffice a good replacement for Microsoft Office?,"Hello everyone. I'm making my switch to Linux in the upcoming weeks. But I'm worried about office apps. I'm not looking for advanced features. I just want to be able to write documents and create sheets. Also, my university expects me to turn in Microsoft Word documents. If I convert from these 2 alternatives, will everything convert properly? Sometimes they will require specific layouts, bezels, line spacing, font and size. Will they get messed up while converting?

Thank you!

Edit: I've gotten so many great responses, thank you everyone. My school is VERY serious about formatting so I think I'll stick to MS Office for now. Once I switch to Linux I'll use Office 365 with my school account, so it's free of costs. I'm still going to give LibreOffice a try though. Again, thank you everyone! :)","LibreOffice is a great alternative that's just as powerful.  However, formatting of files between LibreOffice and MS Office isn't perfect.  It has gotten BETTER in the recent versions, however.

OnlyOffice is VERY good with formatting compatibility, but is lacking some of the features.  So if it'll work for you or not comes down to how complex your files are."

"Am I the only one who thinks ""How To Ask Questions The Smart Way"" is incredibly condescending and toxic?","I have been researching an issue I have been having with my Manjaro installation for the last few days and several times have wanted to make a post on either the Manjaro or ArchLinux subreddits requesting help and/or guidance. First off, I know I am not owed help by anyone from the community and I am very appreciative for any help I do receive. I try to help others with their issues whenever I can because I love Linux and I love the community. I really want new users to discover all the freedom Linux has to offer and I would like to help others with their journey in any way I can.

One thing that greatly irritates me is the elitist gatekeeping attitude I see on the Manjaro and Arch forums. I know this isn't exclusive to these two distros but it seems to be the most prevalent. Whenever I research an issue I see forum post, after forum post of people asking the same questions I have hoping to fix a similar issue only for them to be told to RTFM, STFW, Google is your friend, etc. They also sometimes Link to [How to Ask Questions the Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). This is the most condescending thing I have ever been linked to that I can recall.

To me it seems like the same people who are complaining about Microsoft's dominance in the desktop market are the same ones who are driving away new would-be Linux users.

Why do some people restrict themselves to FOSS only?,"I'm not sure if this has been asked before or if this is the right sub and I’m probably gonna get a lot of hate for this, but I'm curious about why some people swear to live only by FOSS? Don’t get me wrong, I love Linux (I work as a sysadmin, and any chance I get to use Linux I would prefer it over Windows) and open source software is great and all, what I don’t understand is people going full zealot, Richard Stallman-esque, religiously only using FOSS. I mean, I use proprietary software for the sake of ease, for example I’m a gamer and I have an Nvidia GPU, I have no other choice but to either switch back to Windows to get the best performance in games, or use proprietary drivers which is really not a huge deal for me.

Why is my PC much quieter on Linux than Windows?,"Hello guys,

I recently bought a new NVMe and I installed Linux (Ubuntu 20.04) for the very first time in the old SSD of 500 GB.

The first thing I noticed and I like it pretty much is that my PC much quieter/silent compared to when using Windows. I think it's the GPU (Gigabyte GeForce GTX 970 G1) that has a much lower usage than on Windows.

Is there any reason for this? Maybe the Nouveau display driver?

Thank you for your time!","No offence to anyone who answered already but it looks like they didn't finish reading the question (dw, I get it, I do it all the time too!), so to answer your question..
For programming - everything is just way easier to get up and running. What felt confusing and overwhelming on OSX or windows was mostly pretty painless on Linux. Also, that it is quite terminal-centric it forces you to learn it faster, when you know enough of what you're doing ahead of time you can write a bash script to automate those steps, or python or node script, or even a C program if you do not fear the God's - almost anything you want.

"If Linux is just a kernel, where is the operating system?","What packages/files/software comprise the operating system exactly? Is it in the package manager? The coreutils, or some other important set of packages like Debian's base-files? Something else? In other words, how does a distribution communicate with the Linux kernel?

Maybe it's addressed in the LFS manual, but I haven't gotten a chance to look at it yet.","Not as good a job as I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called ""Linux"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.

Best way to run Office 365 on Linux? (sadly),"Don't get me wrong, I hate proprietary shits just as much as most of you do, but I need to run Office 365. Latex would have been way better for me, but unfortunately the branch of academia I'm in is completely dominated by Microsoft products. Hence I'm required to use Office in order to maintain compatibility with others. It's not fair, but it is what it is.

I deeply appreciate Libreoffice project but the compatibility, although very good, isn't perfect sometimes and I can't really afford to risk breaking compatibility with other people.

I have been using online Office 365 for free but it is severely limited and slow. I also hate putting all the documents in Microsoft's cloud.

I could use wine to run Office 365 inside Linux but it would open up all sorts of security holes (ruined home directory by ransomwares?). Does it even work? I don't know.

The best way would probably be to set up a Windows VM and run Office 365 inside that, but I don't want to buy a Windows license just to run a single software.

Of course, all of these would have been solved if Microsoft would just publish Office 365 as a snap package, but I don't think it would be good idea to hold my breath for that.

So folks, can I get your opinions please?

EDIT: I'm disappointed. The most common reply I got was to use Windows. That was not my question. I asked this question because I require Linux personally for almost everything except Office 365.

Is Linux memory management just *that* much better than Windows?,"I recently had to switch to Ubuntu on my ageing laptop as Windows is becoming dead slow. Everything takes ages to load on boot (like 10 minutes plus until the system is usable), and then anything new I open will also take a long time to load etc.

In Ubuntu, the thing just flies. 

Now, I thought this was a swap issue. Windows quickly fills up my 4GB RAM and then puts another 2 or 3 in swap (with the browser open) from the get go.  
But then I am looking at the system monitor in Ubuntu and it's a very similar situation. It doesn't fill up as fast, but e.g. right now RAM is 91% full and 2GB in swap, and the OS is still flying. Everything is very smooth, no lag or delays in opening anything.

Let me give you an example, when I was a web developer, every morning I opend the same 3 things: lectures folder, VS code, and a notes files, it felt so redundant so I automated it. Instead of clicking around every time, I wrote a small script and saved it as start-day.sh, gave it permission with chmod +x start-day.sh, and just run it with ./start-day.sh.

Extreme performance difference between linux and windows,"This isn't your generic ""hoo boy my chrome opens 2 seconds faster i love linux!"". Windows was absolutely horrible on my desktop.

I literally just assumed constant BSOD's, freezes, lockups, etc were just something you put up with, unless you spent a lot more money.

Shouldn't it be called Linux/GNU and not GNU/Linux?,"I understand that GNU came first and linux was the missing heart (kernel) of an operating system. But just from an english standpoint. Linux being a kernel is lower level than GNU as GNU is a bunch of coreutils. So GNU is built on top of Linux no?

Why is it not fair to call Linux Linux/GNU or Linux+GNU and not GNU/Linux? Considering GNU is not even essential to have a working linux distribution.

Excuse if this is a nooby question. I am relatively new to GNU/Linux as a whole.

EDIT: Holy dooly, didn't know this was such a spicy topic.","Not really wanting to get into the whole GNU+linux discussion...usually I don't care much, call it what you prefer. For me I usually just say linux but I use GNU/Linux when the distinction to non-gnu distros is important.

But there are a few things on your post that might need some clarifying...

>So GNU is built on top of Linux no?

Yes and no. Historically it's a clear no...gnu is much older than the linux kernel and the linux kernel was specifically written to run gnu's glibc, bash and gcc on it. Also important to mention that the linux kernel isn't the only kernel GNU software runs on...actually I am not sure if there are any ""major"" kernels gnu doesn't run on ;). But technically of course true, the kernel is lower level than the GNU userspace.

>Considering GNU is not even essential to have a working linux distribution.

Again...true to some extent but also misleading a bit. It is true that GNU is not necessray for a linux distribution...but it is also true that without the GNU userspace or an alternative you can't make a linux distro either. Every program on your system needs a libc..in the case of GNU distros that is glibc. And more than that...the libc is also responsible for dynamic loading libraries ( through /lib/ld-linux.so.2 to be precise). So without a userspace like GNU a computer only running the linux kernel would be pretty much a brick on your desk..it can't do anything at all.

That is what makes GNU so special...it's not like systemd (what people seem to love to throw in these discussion) which is almost completely irrelevant to a working system. There are probably a handful of applications that really need systemd to run...in comparison to every single binary on your system needing a libc (be that glibc or any of the alternatives). 

Also important to understand that for programs the GNU userspace interface (or alternatives) is usually more important than the kernel itself. Not many programs talk directly to the kernel, most go through the libc layer. Which brings us back to the ""Considering GNU is not even essential""..the exactly same can be said about the linux kernel. We have an example of this right now in use by lots of people..Microsofts WSL1. Basically Microsoft wrote a linux kernel replacement that can run an unmodified glibc and because of that many linux programs without any modifications. You install an existing linux distro on it...only without the linux kernel. No changes to the distro needed..the precompiled binaries just work. And that is mostly thanks to GNU userspace (or again..any alternatives here..it's not important that it is gnu..it is important that it exists in the first place).

Then to the point where using GNU/Linux is actually really meaningful...binary compatibility. As said above..every program on your system goes through the libc. Yes, there are plenty of alternatives to GNU's glibc out there like ulibc or musl. But those libraries are not binary compatible...ony API compatible. Meaning you can usually compile the same sourcecode and it works on both...but you can not take the binary compiled for one and run it on the other. So...now we have things like the propritary nvidia drivers or steam for which we have no access to the sourcecode...we can not recompile them to any other libc. We are stuck to the libc the companies used when creating their binaries...and that is glibc. Only GNU/linux systems can run steam or use the nvidia drivers...distro's using alternative userspaces like alpine linux can not (at least not without installing almost a complete distro minus the kernel in parallel that is based on glibc). So for binary program compatibility mentioning it runs on GNU/linux is essential."
Where does 'sudoer incident' is reported?,"I was wondering, while using first time 'sudo' command, and if  you're  not in the sudoers file. Where does actually this 'incident' is reported  ? Does this do anything other than showing that message?","[Santa](https://xkcd.com/838/).

In practice it all depends on the `mail_*` settings in your `/etc/sudoers` file. By default it will be mailed to `root`. Typically one would have `root` mail going to a real user.

There's other things that can produce mail. Cron and At jobs, for instance. So just throwing it all away &mdash; or worse yet, letting it pile up in an unread mailbox &mdash; is a bit silly."
"Why does ""snap"" get so much hate? I'm trying to understand what it even is","I see in many corners of the internet ""snap"" getting a lot of hate.  What exactly is it and why do so many dislike it?  I tried to understand it from reading but I just don't get it.

Is it sort of like AppImage?  To me, AppImage seems brilliant.

\*\*update\*\*

So I never expected to get such a large response from this question!  I've been reading comments as they come in and it seems like the general dislikes are:

1) closed-source leaning

2) bulky and slow

I can respect that.  I was really curious because on my Debian server I run 100% of my network apps as Docker containers and I've found docker to be nothing short of brilliant for this.  Snaps, Flatpaks and AppImages all seemed to be logical cousins to Docker and so I became quite curious.  Thank you for all of this input!  Open-source or NO SOURCE!","Snap does solve some problems that AppImage also solves but there are differences. It installs self-contained packages (no external dependencies) which are also run in a sandbox. Reasons people hate it are

* closed-source server component
* hard-coded canonical repos
* limited control over updates
* ubuntu pushes it in situations users feel it isn't useful (some default apps are snaps, `apt` can install snaps without the user noticing)

Personally, I find it hard to justify using snap over flatpak. But I use neither anyway."

How to Really Learn Linux??,"After using Linux for let's say 5 months...

"Why do different desktop environments and many distros ""reinvent the wheel"" by having their own suite of basic applications?","I understand that it partially involves which widget toolkit (GTK+ or Qt) was used to create the desktop environment, but then there are large projects like GIMP that will run on both GTK+ and Qt-based desktop environments. So wouldn't it be quite a bit easier to make just a few of these relatively simpler applications that look and function well on multiple DEs/distros? I get that not everybody wants the same editor or image viewer, but it seems like a big duplication of effort for application types that don't change a lot over time and have been done so many times before.","Because most DEs are developed as DEs, not as just shells and WMs. They have a design goal to achieve: a cohesive environment where all native tools function more or less identically.

Take a look at file browsers, for example:

* Thunar achieves its goal of being lightweight and simplistic, usually being one of the de-facto file managers for pieced-together DEs.

* Nautilus, in addition to being one of the first to support Wayland, plays towards Gnome's goals of a simple workflow with minimal distractions.

* Dolphin integrates with tons of Plasma, including Baloo (file indexer) and parts of the shell. It also focuses on extensive configurability.

Just looking at these three, you can see that there's no one-size-fits-all file browser, much less image viewer, text editor, etc. Rolling your own is just simpler than using someone else's or maintaining a patch set."
Your most embarrassing Linux moment?,"As the most questions in this sub discuss problems and their possible solutions, this is a question of another kind to spice it up.

What was your most embarrassing Linux (or related software) moment?

To begin: probably when I tried to help my ex to install Linux alongside Windows 7 as dual boot, which I fucked up. I messed irreparable with the partitions, the device needed setup from scratch. Fortunately I forced her to do a backup directly before (what I bright moment of mine). She got fed up and turned to her later boyfriend, who installed Windows 10 and set up a virtual machine inside.

Defeat on all fronts.

Until then I never said again that is ""it's foolproof, easily done and a no-brainer"". Do backups often and redundantly, folks.

Original Question: Hello I am sick of Windows and I'm taking the effort to learn enough Linux to move away from Microsoft altogether.  Now seems like a good time.

I am not a ""Linux guy"" or a ""Windows guy"", I'm just a guy with a lot of work to do.

After several days, my concern is that Linux might just be a never ending hobby instead of a tool that can be configured and then used.

I own a business and have a family, so I have no time for an additional hobby.  Nor do I plan on giving up what free time I have to play with an operating system, I'd rather be gaming.

Is there a point where I can just use the computer to complete tasks or is the computer always going to BE THE TASK?  Playing around with my operation system does not put money in my bank account.

I am not trying to be snarky, I just want to avoid wasting time if this is not possible.  I am fully aware that there is a skills gap here, but I am smart and willing to learn if there is a payout to be had.

Any helpful thoughts?","If you go for a stable, easy to use distro like Mint, you just need to install it and start doing work. I also have a real job that I need to use my computer for, and seldom have time to tinker with the computer just for fun. I use Mint, and everything just works."
Who was the main reason where you left windows for linux(desktop)?,"I see many people talk about privacy, freedom in general, open-source and stuff like that.None talks about system curiosity-exploration-understanding.Im very curious about your real thoughts.

Is privacy really matters, when your half applications proprietary stuff?

I am very well aware of the achievements of linux.Im a Linux fan also and i respect the whole philosophy.

What's your real reasons?","The privacy of the OS does matter, even if there are proprietary applications. It's still one less vector for data gathering. Saying it doesn't matter because of proprietary applications is incorrect because it still makes a difference, even if it's not perfect, and a slight improvement is better than nothing. It's like saying that closing the bathroom curtain is worthless because your living room curtain is still open- yes, ideally you should close that too, but it's still better than having both open.

Main reasons for me: privacy, speed, better updates that don't break the OS completely after a while, being able to uninstall the programs I don't want, being able to customize and experiment because I can get into everything, getting to learn how my OS actually works and troubleshoot my own problems, good community support that actually tries to solve the problem instead of suggesting a reinstall every time, massively improved resource usage on a laptop that's not the beefiest (went from 70% RAM on the regular to 30% at most), and general curiosity.

the term **stable** when discussing linux distros does not mean 'wont crash' - It is often taken to  mean ""version number of packages dont change""   Or at least not changes until they have gone through a lot of testing.  

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/634710/what-does-it-mean-for-a-linux-distribution-to-be-stable-and-how-much-does-it-mat

So 'bleeding edge' and 'stable' are often a bit of opposite needs.   

>  not bloated, 

Other than some of these Gaming Focused  Distros, I rarely find any of the mainstream distros bloated.

I am currently Testing Bazzite - which is Fedora On an immutable os-tree setup, so it a bit unusual, and does include a large # of things, which i will never use, but other gamers may want from the start.  So My 'bloat' is their 'must have' extras. 

If you want a 'reliable' distro - look into those that include various rollback/snapshot systems from the start.  Then you can be bleeding edge, and roll back if any updates cause specific issues.

This is a main selling point of Bazzite, and other Fedora SilverBlue distros and their Immutable design.  But it does come with costs in other areas of the distro.

Try them out - see if they suit your needs. 

One annoyance with bazzite - is it does not have a live-usb setup you can test.  You have to install it.   But I am currently moving to it on my main system after testing it for a few months.   Again - it may not suite all people, but its rather innovative in many ways.  

You could always look into the normal Fedora as well."

"Why is it ""good"" to have all drivers in the Kernel?","Hi, 

I often hear that is it very nice that all (well, most) drivers are directly baked into the Linux Kernel. Which is convenient, since most hardware runs out of the box without installing it, I understand that. However, as a software developer, I think a modular solution, opposed to a monolithic one, is usually preferable.

Does the monolithic approach mean, that the Kernel is bloated with a lot of drivers for so much hardware? Why is it not setup in a way, that drivers can be installed as packages, when they are needed?","Drivers are in the kernel source tree. At runtime they're modules that are loaded on demand. 

The kernel has everything AVAILABLE, but only uses what is needed. It's not bloated and everybody wins. 

Modules can be provided by external venders, but then they have to maintain kernel compatibility - effectively chasing any kernel ABI changes"
How much of the original kernel from '91 is still in the newest kernel?,"Related, could you compile code from '91 on a modern computer (and vice versa)?","I don't know about the kernel question. But you could definitely compile C/C++ code from 91, on a system today. C is pretty good at backwards compatibility. If you can install all the needed dependencies. Compiling code today, on an older computer, would be harder. Forward's compatibility doesn't work as well. You could try to write code, constrained to that '91 computer, but if you use a newer feature of C or C++, or include some modern library, it won't work."
Why is using sudo considered more secure than logging in directly as root?,"If my user account gets compromised by malware, and I use sudo, that malware has several ways to read my sudo password or hitch a ride on my sudo session, effectively gaining root privileges.

But if I press ctrl alt f3 or so, and login directly as root, without taking a detour to my user account, a malware has a much harder time to mess with my root session, it would probably require a 0day exploit to do so.

I am talking about a desktop system with me as the only user, not a server or a multiuser system.","In your specific scenario, sudo is less secure. But it is also much more convenient. (And before sudo became common, many people used su. They didn't log in as root on a separate tty.) Also, on a single-user desktop system, all the really important data belongs to that user. So if malware runs as your user, you have already lost. It doesn't gain much by running as root."

This keyboard and every other Bluetooth device I have work perfectly fine in windows, wtf Linux?","> Why is Bluetooth completely awful in linux

One reason is that Bluetooth is completely awful everywhere -- Android, iPhone, Windows, smart TVs and others. Linux Bluetooth handling is slowly improving, but it's still a PITA to use.

> In Ubuntu it constantly disconnects or falls asleep(as do every other Bluetooth device) and I'll have to tap keys till it figures out its being used.

That's a normal Bluetooth peripheral behavior, it's true everywhere, it's necessary to keep from running down the battery.

If you want a decent wireless keyboard and mouse combo, get the Logitech low-end offering which is about $25 right now. I can say from direct experience that the least expensive Logitech product is better than the most expensive Bluetooth product.

I walked into an office recently, saw a Logitech keyboard, and asked the owner, ""How often do you have to replace the battery?"" The person replied, ""What? This has a battery?"" She had been using it for a year."

Why would Zoom run a newer version for Linux than Windows?,"If there's a better place to ask this then please direct me there :)

There were updates for Zoom recently, and I noticed that the chat looked different than usual. Seems this wasn't changed in the Windows version, according to my boyfriend, and it turns out that the Linux version is on build 5.4.5 while Windows is and Mac are on 5.4.1. 

I would have assumed the exact opposite if there are any version discrepancies. My first thought was that the Linux client is being used as a beta test of sorts (which lol if that's the case). I'm just wondering if there's any explanation for this.","Usually the 3rd number of a version is for bug and security fixes.  It's possible that there have only been Linux-specific fixes in version 5.4.2 thru 5.4.5.  There would be no reason to release those for Windows users.

It's also possible they are using Linux users as beta testers to protect their bigger Windows and Mac audiences from regressions.

Or maybe their deployment pipeline is more efficient under Linux.   Versions 5.4.5 may be on its way but just hasn't arrived yet for all users.

It's all just speculation until a Zoom employee says otherwise."

The architecture itself isn't the issue when it comes to Apple. Since they make their own silicon and OS, they have the ability (and exercise it) to lock down their systems. Even on their ""hybrid"" Macs with an Intel main CPU and (ARM) T2 co-processor, in the default state you cannot run Linux on it due to the T2 secure boot. For now it's possible to disable that security mechanism, but I don't find it hard to believe that they will remove that option at some point."

What got you using linux?,"For me, it started when I received a raspberry pi as a gift a few years ago. learning how to use it got me started with linux, but it was still new and foreign to me and I was a long time windows user, so I didnt fully switch until Windows was updating and it nuked itself. I used the raspberry pi to make a bootable usb drive of Debian and I never looked back :) that was probably one of the best things to ever happen to me to be completely honest, it unlocked a whole new world of possibilities.

How do I convince my aunt/mom Linux is safe?,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible. I live with my aunt, but she's pretty much my mom at this point, so I'll just call her Mom.

Basically, I'm getting a new laptop in a few months, and I was thinking about switching from Windows 10/11 to **mainly** Linux for this new machine. It sounds to me like there are a few nice pros and not many cons, so it seems like an enticing option. (I don't really play online games with AntiCheat)

There are two main reasons for switching: Privacy benefits, and no Norton.

I've got the first one covered, but the second one is the main issue. I probably don't need to explain how shady/annoying Norton is here... If you know, you know.

But while my mom admits Norton is really shady at times, she'd never use a computer without an AV. The thought of having no antivirus on my new laptop (or even using something like ClamAV) really rubs her the wrong way, and now she's suspicious of Linux as a whole. She's doubtful that there'd be a free OS that didn't sell your information or do anything behind your back; to her, nothing is ever so simple.

I know that no system is 100% safe, but I've heard that Linux is not as vulnerable to malware in general compared to Windows. So finally, here's my question: How do I convince her beyond a shadow of a doubt that Linux is just as safe as Windows virus-wise?

I'm sorry if this is a dumb question. I *have* actually heard some things like ""just don't give programs root access"" thrown around, though I don't fully understand it. Basically, is ClamAV effective, and is it even necessary? And where are some sources I could read out to her so that she understands?

&#x200B;

LATE EDIT: I'm currently a minor, and she's the one paying for it, so that's why it's important that I convince her.","""Think free as in free speech, not free beer."" 

The real benefit and strength of Linux is that it is free as in few restrictions. It's one of the most widely used operating systems (by some counts the most widely used, including internet servers) for a reason. The open source nature of Linux means that many of the world's best programmers have contributed their expertise to its code base. And, it is open source, meaning anyone can review the source code for themselves. What would you trust more, code that is review able by anyone? Or proprietary software that you're not allowed to see the inner workings of? 

The fact that the software is free as in free beer is an amazing fact that still boggles my mind.

Absolute most dangerous command in linux?,"I am familiar with the

    sudo rm -rf /* 

and yes, this is very dangerous. Like I get it. Beyond comprehension. However, I have ran this command and while everything does get removed and the VM won't boot the next time around, my current shell is still intact. For example, I run:

    user@vm:/$ echo we still alive out here?
    we still alive out here?

Sure \``ls` might be gone:

    user@vm:/$ ls
    -bash: /usr/bin/ls: No such file or directory

but it still knows to print that error message. If I ssh, I want the output to be:

    ...connection lost

Anybody know a command so deadly, that upon running it, the OS will instantly crash to an unrecoverable state and corrupt everything? Could this command even exist? is the linux kernel designed for this?","If you don't know what you're doing or you're not paying attention, it's easily `dd`"
Why do Linux users in general avoid Chrome?,"Is it just because they don't trust Google with their data , or is it the Power consumption? 


I understand that it's probably a matter of opinion but I usually see Linux users avoid chrome like crazy all the time. Might just be an observation bias but I'm certainly curious either way.",For me it’s having deGoogled all of my systems and services for privacy reasons.
For what reason did you switch over to Linux?,I'm considering switching over to Linux and just want to know for what reasons other people did.,"I switched to Linux completely because of a mistake.

Many years ago, I only played around with Linux. As a result, I had to reinstall regularly. During a new installation, I always selected ""use all existing Linux partitions"". Well, at some point I selected ""use all existing partitions"" instead. And Windows was gone. 

Because I had backed up my personal data, that was no problem. If I had found my Windows CD. But I didn't. So I was forced to familiarise myself with Linux very quickly. By the way, a few weeks later a friend brought the CD back to me. I had apparently lent it out.

But I didn't install Windows again until months later. Nowadays I only use it for a few games that are not usable under Linux or only with considerable effort."
Tip of the hat - sshfs,"Just a tip of the hat to linux.  The more I learn about Linux, the more I realize it is the OS that can do anything you can throw at it.  Anything you can think of, someone has already done.  Once you get a feel for how it drives, the syntax even begins to look familiar.

I was tinkering about late last night and after transferring some files over SCP I found myself wondering, could I just make that remote home directory sub folder available at all times? Sure enough sshfs.

I quickly discovered I can mount remote directories locally over ssh with sshfs.

sshfs user@remote:/remote/directory /localmount/directory -o IdentityFile=/pathto/sshkeys

Well done again Linux.","On some rooted Android devices, there is a working port of sshfs. I find this immensely useful. For those interested, it is in the Play Store and called EasySSHFS, and it's by not_w."
I've been using WSL 2 for the past few months and now I really wanna switch to linux .,"I've been a Windows user my whole life and recently, I started using openFOAM for CFD. Up until then, I hadn't really looked into open source stuff.  I started using Ubuntu 20.04 through WSL and it was my first experience working with the terminal. It was quite frustrating in the beginning but it has grown on me ever since.

Last week, I tried out virtual box to see for myself what the GUI was like. I was really impressed with how everything looked and now I don't see why I shouldn't make the switch. I already use Libre office so I'd only be missing out on few games and Windows Mail.

Even when I'm not running anything, the ram is at least 60% full. I've read that windows is really clunky with things like this so I'm also expecting a boost in performance and responsiveness.

My only concern is that I have an nvidia card and my laptop came with windows preinstalled. How does one update the hardware on linux? What are some things I gotta look out for when I install a distro? Also, what distro would you recommend? Like I said, I have a little experience with ubuntu but I don't mind looking into other options. I came across  Pop OS on youTube ( it has an option to specify that you're running an nvidia card n all!) but I'm still not sure about it . Right now, using openFoam is a priority and their website doesn't mention anything about pop OS. What is compatibility like in the linux world? The amount of options is overwhelming, especially for a new user/outsider like me.  Some help would be amazing. Thankyou!","PopOS is a good choice and if openFoam works on Ubuntu then it will work on Pop too (since Pop is Ubuntu based). 

NVIDIA works fine on any distro though it sometimes requires some configuration if you need to use the proprietary drivers. The open source drivers (nouveau) are plug and play in my experience."
Why would a streaming service not be compatible with linux?,I wanted to stream live TV from my cable providers browser streaming service but I says that it is only compatible with mac and windows. I would've thought that most of the work would be getting handled by the browser and the OS wouldn't matter considering I'm not installing anything or trying to run an application. Clearly I was wrong but now I'm curious why this is the case. I'm sure this is a loaded question but why would a video service not be compatible with linux if it is compatible with the browser being used?,"DRM might be a reason. It is probably easier to circumvent DRM on Linux than on Windows or macOS, so a streaming service or the rightsholders might decide not to make their content available on Linux."
If Linux is a modular system with decoupled components why are all the drivers in the kernel?,"It would make more sense for then to be separate so you can choose what to install or not just like with other OS components

Linux as in a GNU/Linux distribution I know it’s the kernel, still my post applies considering the drivers are in the kernel instead of a separate part of the OS","Because it’s monolithic. But I realize that’s a bit of a tautology, so… Linux doesn’t provide a stable ABI for drivers to target. As such, they need to be updated whenever a breaking change happens elsewhere in the kernel. As such, they are also included in the kernel. Part of this is ideological. As they’re part of the kernel, they have to be GPL licensed. (Some drivers *can* be outside the kernel, like Nvidia’s, and they can be licensed differently.)

A microkernel architecture would include them outside the kernel as you suggest, usually as user-level processes, which is generally considered to be more stable and robust, but historically at the cost of performance (modern microkernels have made good progress overcoming that though). Redox is an example of that."
How do I get fluent in Linux?,"I migrated from windows a couple months ago, got mint, liked it, but heard manjaro was great for gaming, so I got that, and I can work the gui and stuff, but im totally swinging in the dark when it comes to terminal stuff and I want to be able to understand things like installing a distro without a graphic installer, and how to use configurations and fluently be able to customize my experience.
What subjects should I look into to understand things like installation, permissions, network management, etc? So far I pretty much only know how to use pacman and nmtui.","Normally I would not recommend this for a newbie. However since you are using Manjaro (which is based on Arch) and are interested in the nuts and bolts of how Linux works and how to customize your experience I would recommend Arch linux. Not as a replacement for Manjaro, but as a Virtual Machine for learning. Get GNOME Boxes, virt-manager, VirtualBox or whatever vm tool you like and follow the arch Linux wiki beginner install guide. Then pick a desktop and look at the arch wiki entry for that. The arch wiki is a very deep rabbit hole and also an amazing reference that is useful even if you don't use Arch.

Expect to spend most of the day, or even a weekend installing Arch the first time. You will likely fail and have to start from scratch again. This is why you should use a VM to learn, you can mess up and start over very easily. And also use documentation right on the same computer without having to use another computer or a phone for the docs.

It's also highly possible that you'll look at the install guide and say, nope, this is not for me. And that is totally fine too. If that is the case look for mini tutorials online for the specific things you want ot learn. Want to learn the command line? Search for bash tutorials. Want to learn about tiling window managers?  Look up dwm, i3 or sway.

My Linux journey was similar to this. I used Ubuntu briefly and then decided I wanted to get my hands dirty so I switched to Arch and that lasted for about 2 years. Now for the last 6 years or so I've been using Fedora and have never regretted the switch.

No matter which distro or program you go with, your most valuable tool for learning Linux stuff is [duckduckgo.com](https://duckduckgo.com) or google, if you must. Wow, that got long fast. Good Luck!"
Why does Ubuntu get so much hate from Linux YouTubers?,"So, a little backstory to this question to explain why I’m asking. Twelve years ago, I purchased a brand new 13” MacBook Pro. It served me well for 6 years, then I got a job that issued a Windows laptop and I was just too lazy to use two different laptops so the MacBook got stuck on a shelf and neglected. 

This year, my wife and I decided to try a new hobby of tinkering with electronics like the Arduino and Le Potato from Libre Computer. 

I figured if we were going to be working on these things, I should use a personal computer and not risk the work laptop. So I pulled down the old MacBook Pro and realized I can’t update to the latest MacOS any longer. Grabbed an Ubuntu iso and minus a few driver issues that were resolved after a few Google searches and Reddit, it’s been working amazing and I’m excited to use my MacBook again everyday. 

I chose Ubuntu because I played with it a little back in the days before my MacBook and it felt like the best desktop experience of the other distros at the time. 

Now, after googling all these things about Linux, I’m getting served YouTube videos about Linux and boy, there’s a lot of shade being thrown at Canonical. 

Can someone give me a TL;DR on what happened in the last 10-12 years? 

Last I remember, nearly everyone in the community loved Ubuntu, especially as a gateway to Linux. What happened? It still seems fine to me.","I'm an extremely experienced linux admin - desktop and server.  BSD, \*NIX of all kinds (Solaris and AIX the most, although I've done HP-UX).  I've done Gentoo (stage 1, back when that was the ""cool thing to do""), RedHat (pre-Fedora/RHEL), you name it.  Was a huge Mandrake fan back in the day before it became Mandriva and went weird.  Then was SuSE for years.  If it existed, I used it.  

You ask me to build a desktop that just works with Linux?  I'm snagging the latest Ubuntu LTS and dropping it on there.  It works.  DKMS works for Nvidia cards.  Drivers work.  Everything is documented to hell and back if something breaks, because it's common and popular.  Patch process works and is almost flawless.  Upgrade between LTS works and is pretty damned flawless, in comparison.  My job isn't making a distro work anymore - it's using one to get a job done these days, and Ubuntu does the job easily.  Plus again - documented to hell and back.  Nothing like troubleshooting something when you can't find docs for whatever tweaks the distro maintainers did, and Canonical does a GREAT job (and the community too) at documenting how they tweaked things."

Thank You, Folks!","Since i can't find usual comment to hate and oppose DRM, i am inserting it here.

Just wondering what && means in command line?,Just wondering what && means in command line?,"In `a && b`, `b` will be executed iff `a` returns 0 (success).

Note it is different from `;`. `a ; b` will execute `b`, regardless of success or failure of `a`.

**EDIT**: Some other useful things that have been pointed out in the comments.

Other useful shortcuts can be found by executing `man bash` on terminal. I encourage you to check it out.

I have assumed there are no infinite commands.

Commands such as `&&`, `||`, etc are often used to chain and execute multiple commands with *an* alias instead of creating a `.sh` file.

Since I've touched on the combinations of `&` and `|`, here are some more that have been mentioned in the comments.

`a &` will execute `a` in the background

In `a | b`, the `|` is called a pipe.

The pipe turns the output of `a` into the input of `b`. You can chain multiple times like `a | b | c | ...` to make a pipeline.

`iff` stands for [If and only If](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if). It is commonly known as ""bi-implication""  and denoted with `<=>`."

Is Linux worth it?,"Hi all,

I will be buying a new laptop for university in the next few months and am drawn to the 2020 Dell XPS 15, which can be purchased with Linux OS out of the box as an alternative to Windows 10 I will be using this laptop for educational purposes as well as some light gaming/other entertainment facilities. I have never used Linux before but have heard good things about it in tech forums and from a few friends so I am open to the idea of making the leap.

Is it a suitable alternative to Windows for the things I need? Is it easy to learn? Would it be worth the transition?

Many thanks :)","You will obviously get very biased answers on a sub devoted to Linux, but yeah, it can be a good fit for all the needs you described. Linux distros are complete operating systems, capable of doing all the same things that a Windows or Apple system can do. 

In many cases it might do the same things differently, but this is simply a matter of perspective. Once you use Linux long enough, Windows becomes the OS that does things differently in unfamiliar ways, it is just what you are used to and personal preference."
Why is Linux Mint always just the beginner distro?,"I've been using Linux for 3 years and have only ever used Mint. But in many Linux forums it is said that Linux mint is just a baby distro and real Linux users use arch. but why? mint has full support, gets updates, is easy to install, has no bloatware, I can replace or configure all things, so why is mint a „baby“ distro?","Anyone that says ""real Linux users do X"" can safely be ignored without further consideration. Linux is flexibility distilled in code. People being snobbish gate keepers telling anyone what they can or can't do don't have the Linux spirit.

That said, if you're looking for increasing your technical knowledge, moving up to distributions that require more and more skill to learn is a good way to do that. Going from Mint to RHEL, Arch, Gentoo, then LFS is a trajectory rich in challenges and learning experience. But if you like Mint for your desktop, you can do all that in VMs, no sense trashing a good thing to score brownie points with elitists."
Is systemd really that bad?,"Whenever I google something about systemd, I hear everything why it's the worst thing ever to happen to Linux, how it's feature creep and violates the Unix philosophy. Yet every mainstream desktop and server distro uses it.

sorry for my possibly stupid noob question and thanks!","Hey,   
As far as i can see, nobody asked you most important question,   
is your Windows installed in EFI mode? (You can check, if first partition on your Disk is flagged as ESP), if yes, you are probably just fine with dual botting, EFI was designed to be able to boot different OSes from executables with efi extension.   
If you have your Windows in EFI mode, just install linux in this mode too.   
When you boot your install ISO, make sure to that Linux is booted in EFI mode,   
run this in terminal ""ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars"" - Normally you should not run random commands from Internet, but this one is completly safe  
\`ls\` is just simple command that LiSt files in specified directory [https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html)   
\`/sys/firmware/efi/efivars\` is special path accessible only in EFI mode, if command above, returns something - You are all go, it means that you are booted in uefi and that you can proceed with install, but if ater running this command, you would see some kind of error saying that this path doesn't exist, it means that you somehow booted into LEGACY mode, it's not linux mistake, you probably misconfigured your UEFI (as BIOS) - check it, and boot linux again.   


After you make sure, that both oses as in EFI mode, you can proceed with installation, pick your existing partition and mount it to \`/boot/EFI\`, then just install Linux with your desired partitioning.   


After this, you need to reboot, change UEFI boot order to entry with ""GRUB"" in it (if there will be no labels, you would need to check each entry, one by one).   
After you are in GRUB, you can simply boot Windows and Linux from IT,   
if somehow, you'll screw your GRUB, you still can pick Windows bootloader from UEFI and boot to it.   


In EFI era, is really simple, there is almost no risk that one system will destroy other's bootloader but in some strange cases it's still possible, so please, remember to do your backups before proceeding!"
can you install Linux on a computer that originally was sold with Windows 10 OS?,I was thinking of buying a used computer and reformatting the hard drive and installing a version of Linux but then I heard that Windows 10 somehow has embedded code in the BIOS so I wonder if that would make problems then if you try to use another OS?,"Yes, I've wiped many computers and laptops and installed various distribution of Linux on them, no issues at all."
Why are Linux iso files so much smaller than MacOS or windows iso files.,For example to update to Big Sur the package was 12 gbs and to install windows 10 it’s like 5.8 gbs but in Manjaro it’s only 2.2 and arch is less then 1 gb,"I remember downloading an Arch iso several years ago that was like 680MB. An Arch iso comes with the Linux Kernel, and some commandline packages so you can install the system. It's super minimal.

Windows 10 is a full OS with a web browser, a graphical system, an AI assistant, 30 years of legacy bloat, and a ton of other shit.

12gbs to update to Big Sur surprises me. That's kind of huge. I downloaded a Big Sur image that was like 9.5gbs and I thought even that was big."
How Linux could have be inspired by Unix if it was a closed source OS?,"Hey,

I'm looking into the history of Linux and further than that in the history of Unix.

Correct me if I'm wrong. Linux is what we call a Unix-like OS. Which means it is inspired by the original Unix operating system that was created by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson. There are plenty others OS in the Unix family that were also all inspired by the Unix operating system.

I'm not quite sure but wasn't Unix a closed source operating system ? If yes, how could have all these OS be inspired by it if they don't know how it worked ? I'm thinking that maybe they are just inspired by the philosophy of Unix which was ""keep it simple"" and not by the code at all. Is it the only thing that links all those systems ? I'm reading contradictory sources. Was the original Unix code released at some point ?

Thank you.","You don't have to know a single line of code to create something in the spirit of the original. That's basically what the whole lawsuit of Oracle against Google over Java was about.

Oracle argued that Google violated their IP by creating something that has the same naming conventions, but different implementation. The courts ruled in favor of Google.

Linux is basically the same. It uses the same principles, syntax, but none of the code of Unix.

There is an international standard, [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX), that defines how programs should be written to be compatible between different Unix(-like) OSes.

There is no mainstream Linux that really adheres closely to that standard. So Linux today is still similar to Unix, but not Unix at all. (BSD flavors on the other hand adhere to the standard. So if you still want Unix, that's where you have to go)

Btw. The original Unix code has been [released](https://computerhistory.org/blog/the-earliest-unix-code-an-anniversary-source-code-release/)."

Thank you in advance!","Good Beginner Distros:

* Mint
* Ubuntu
* Pop!\_OS

* You need software that only runs on Windows. Compatibility layers exists to make these run on Linux, but some applications really can't be fixed this way, like VALORANT, all Adobe products, Microsoft Office.
* Your hardware doesn't play well with Linux."
What filesystem do you use? Anything else than EXT4?,"EXT4 is kinda the goto filesystem for 99% of users when installing a distro. Does anyone use a different filesystem and if yes why? Does it have better performance or something else?

Please don't think that I don't care about you and I don't want to answer but I truly can't answer to all that. I wasn't expecting so many answers and I never before got so many (probably 100+ in total). Thank you all so much! I wish you all to have a great day!!!","Not exactly what you are asking, but related:

* My Fedora laptop runs LVM under ext4.  I like LVM because I can easily resize and snapshot partitions dynamically, without having to switch to zfs or btrfs.  (There are multi-disk features of LVM I don't use.)
* For anything that writes temporary files to the disk often, I'll use tmpfs.   This makes my builds run faster and reduces wear on my physical disk.
* At work, Redhat servers use xfs.  Wasn't my call and I don't know pros/cons.
* I use Docker, Podman, and Kubernetes which make use of the overlay2 file system (or equivalent).  Overlay2 is a layered files system supporting copy-on-write.  It's useful for caches, testing and immutable base layers."

How exactly is SSH safe?,"This question is probably stupid, but bear with me, please.

I thought that the reason why SSH was so safe was the asymmetrical encryption based on public/private key pairs.

But while (very amateurly) configuring a NAS of mine, I realized that all I needed to add my public key to the authorized clients list of the server was my password.

Doesn't that defeat the purpose?

I understand my premises are probably wrong from the start, and I appreciate every insight.","You're on the right track, and it's not a stupid question at all! Let's break down why SSH with public/private keys is still secure, even though you use a password initially.

Here's the key distinction:

* **Password**: Used to initially add your public key to the server's authorized\_keys list. This is a one-time step during setup.
* **Public/Private Key Pair**: Used for ongoing secure authentication after the initial setup.

Here's the process:

1. You generate a public/private key pair on your local machine.
2. You **need** a password to add the **public key** (not the private key) to the authorized\_keys file on the server. This is like giving your fingerprint (public key) to the server, but you need a password (temporary verification) to confirm your identity.
3. Once added, the server trusts anyone who can prove they possess the corresponding **private key** (which you keep secret).

So, the password is only used for the initial setup and doesn't compromise the ongoing security of SSH key authentication. Even if someone steals the public key (which is harmless), they can't log in without your private key.

Here's an analogy:

Imagine your house has a deadbolt lock (public key). You can give copies of the key (public key) to friends, but they also need a one-time code (password) to be buzzed in (add the key to the authorized list) for the first visit. After that, they can only enter with their physical key (private key).

So, SSH with public/private keys offers strong security because your private key remains confidential and is required for ongoing authentication."
How is Linux so fast?,"Hello, i just got a steam deck and using the sd card between windows and steamos was a nightmare so i decided to try and dual boot linux, and holyyyyy ! the transfer speeds are so fast, i wonder why windows transfer speed aren't as fast ? thank you","I can think of two reasons:

1. Linux filesystems are faster. Ext4 will easily outperform NTFS because it doesn't have all the hooks that slow the latter down. Windows devs actually recommend the practice of splitting your system drive because the NTFS partition Windows is running from has additional hooks which slow it down.

2. Linux is lying. By default, Linux will tell you that a transfer is finished after the file is read into RAM, not when it's actually written, which is only really noticeable if you're writing to a really slow storage medium. This way, you can start working on the file much sooner, but if you want to detach the drive, you need to wait until it's actually written. If you press eject it should start this process and it won't tell you to that it's safe to remove until it actually is. You can see the amount of pending data with `grep 'Dirty' /proc/meminfo` and force it to be committed to disk with `sync`."

But why is such an implementation on GNU/Linux so far behind.,"The Microsoft implementation *seems* to be a compiler made by intel and microsoft in collaboration; it takes the .apk file (basically the same as a .tar.bz2 or similar archive) and then compiles all the Android API Calls (like draw a window of 800x200 and spin up some processes)  into Windows 11 API Calls (which will perform the same task but will need to be translated to API Calls Windows can understand) so that they work NATIVELY on Windows.

People keep saying stuff about Anbox but I call bullshit on that because, literally every person just says, ""There's anbox but I haven't been able to get it to work or haven't used it in 10 years"". Which means it's not there because I haven't seen a single working modern Anbox instance.

People also say to use the Android Studio Android x86 Emulator (Basically a KVM VM) or to set up a Virtualbox VM of Android x86 (Not the official android open source x86 implementation but an unofficial build that boots in Virtualbox and that hasn't seen many updates).

We will probably just have to wait till more information is given away by Intel about how it works, they have literally said nothing about how the ""Intel Bridge Technology"" works on a deeper level which could be because it's not that complex though I doubt that.

It could probably be achieved by a bunch of Linux devs, same thing, translating all the Android API Calls to ones that Linux understands. But it's not been done yet. Heck, maybe if it converts the .apk's to .exe's (or more likely, .appx's which do not work on wine) you could run those apps in Wine although even Wine is such a strange beast. Even Anbox, if someone can get it working, is a strange beast requiring lots of complex configuration, not exactly the one-click install that Microsoft has demoed.

To me, the sad reality (this may be an unpopular opinion on this sub) is that Linux (and FOSS in general) is falling further behind other Desktop Operating Systems (and *SOME* propreitary software) in terms of features and application support. The FOSS Community is too underfunded to keep up with the propreitary giants. In order for some real stuff to happen, there needs to be better funding for the FOSS community which there really isn't right now..."
I'm fucking fed up with windows and want to switch to linux as fast as possible,"Does anybody have any good, accurate guide on how to install a linux OS from windows? I've done some research and feel like there's a lot of conflicting information.

I'm also not sure which OS I'd like to use yet. I was thinking potentially arch because I have a bunch of friends that swear by it, but I'm not sure because I read that has a tough learning curve. Any tips or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!","make the Linux installer usb, boot the usb, do the install. 

You make the USB  'from windows' with a tool like BalenaEtcher.

If you have never used arch, or Linux, then i suggest you dont start with Arch.

You can use  virtualbox to run any linux inside that, and  learn some linux basics.

as for which Linux Distro to use, its all a matter of personal taste. Stick with the mainstream distros and you should be fine.

Personally I prefer Kubuntu, i like KDE over gnome.

Quick Tips

Make a Windows Full Reinstall USB - Before doing an Install - and keep the usb safe - just in case you need it.

When booting the USB - the UEFI/boot menu - can have two entries for the USB, one for 'uefi' mode, one for 'legacy' mode - Be sure to select the right mode for your hardware setup. (UEFI most likely on recent hardware)

If your UEFI has settings for 'AHCI/RAID (also called RST)'    -  Be sure to set that to AHCI."
"Do you try to keep your Linux OS clean? If so, how you do it?",I always install bunch of stuff that I don't need and afterwards it's always too much hassle to find and remove everything that was installed. Anyone else has this problem? How do you fight it?,"Using the nix package manager. It has the `nix-shell`. If I want to try a new tool, I just try it in the nix-shell:

```
nix-shell --packages htop
```

This fetches the package in the nix store, and opens up a new shell instance with the package in `$PATH`. The good thing is, once the `nix-shell` is closed the package in question is marked garbage and will be deleted on the next `nix-collect-garbage`. So, basically no need for me to do something special, I just run the GC every now and then."
Why don’t Adobe and others support Linux?,"Besides the obvious issues that linux has when it comes to compatibility on the platform; the amount of people that use Kdenlive, darktable, and GIMP, is a pretty sizable community!

Allocating development resources to a whole new OS (building support from ZERO) when the minority of people use Linux makes little sense business-wise...

Which is the most underrated Linux distro out there?,"I am sure there is some distro that has still not been acknowledged by many eventhough it is awesome. If you know about such distro, do share it with the community.","Honestly? Debian. I know it's incredibly well known but it often gets eclipsed by the distros based on it becuase they have the latest features and the shiniest new shiny. We owe Debian a _lot_ but everyone tends to ignore it because it's so utterly reliable and boring. Having something that really does _just work_ and is utterly rock solid, going years at a time between reboots is a massive gift and one we really take for granted."
Are Nvidia's drivers THAT bad in Linux?,"I bought a pre-built not long ago with a GTX 1660 ti and windows pre-installed, I used to use Linux on my old PC but with an AMD gpu, so I never had a problem with it. Recently I have been thinking to switch to Linux again, but I always see people saying how bad Nvidia's drivers works in Linux, I am aware that I will not have the same performance as Windows using Nvidia, but I am afraid (and lazy to go back to Windows) ill get more issues with nvidia in Linux that with Windows itself.

EDIT: Wow, this got more attention than I expected! I am reading every single comment of you, I appreciate all information and tips you all are giving me. I'll give a try to Pop!_OS, since it's the distro most of you have mentioned to work pretty well and Manjaro will be my second option if something happens with Pop_os. Thanks for you all replies!.","Just depends who you ask. I had enough problems with Nvidia together with an extreme aversion to supporting companies that deliberately add functions to their hardware to prevent them from being used in VMs that I will never buy Nvidia ever again until they provide a FOSS driver without firmware that prevents me from using it how I choose.

Some people think the FOSS vs proprietary driver debate to be ideological zealotry and that there's no reason to not use Nvidia.

If you already have the hardware, whether it's better or worse than AMD is a moot point, so I say just try it and find out; no random internet stranger's opinion should change your perception about how well it works, and there's plenty of free Linux distros that the cost is not an issue.

When it comes time to vote with your dollar, I will ALWAYS recommend you support a vendor that supplies a FOSS driver over one that only provides a proprietary blob, especially when they intentionally try to cripple your choice in how you use the hardware you bought."
I've seen that RISC-V will have the capabilities to be 128-bit. Is there any application in computer science where this would be deemed useful and/or necessary?,"Pure curiosity, the question just hit me and I would love to know more!","128-bit math (and beyond) does have many uses in scientific applications (think high end physics simulations like protein folding). Also useful in general math stuff (if you're computing to 10,000 places, 128-bit helps).

Finally, for memory address, 128-bit is future proof. We will never need anything more than 128-bit addressing on earth because such a storage device couldn't physical exist on earth (you'd burn the earth to a crisp, and boil the oceans away before you could write that much data to your storage). 64-bit systems already exist that can't address everything."
Will Linux phones ever going to be smooth?,"So I've been following the Pinephone and Librem5 for quite a while now. And while it seems like the core features of a ""smartphone"" are all there or at least very close to being done... it seems that every video I watch about these phones look laggy as hell. These phones are in development for quite a while... is there a reason why they are so damn laggy?

Am I missing something? I always see people praising these phones in the comments as if that is what they're supposed to be like... slow and laggy, I must be missing something for sure, it cant be for real can it?","I think it is because they are focusing on getting the basics right first (Calls, SMS, BT, WiFi, etc...). They are not backed by a giant multi billion company to have 1000+ employees work under the same project so they need to do step by step, little by little. They already have their hands full with touch support in gnome on those aspect ratios. 

Also, the phones are modelled to be relatively cheap so that people can buy them and develop for them. As a consequence, they have crappy specs which translate to the shitty laggy experience. 

The time will come when these phones perform much better with better specs and improved software. What we are seeing now is just the 'okay it works, now to start testing and improving'. The alpha stage."

I think I have misunderstood Linux,"I have made two posts in here asking what specs are recommended in a computer to run Linux. I think my mistake has been that I treat it like a program instead of an OS.

Whether I choose AMD 3, 5, or 7 should depend on what I am using my computer for, e.g. AMD 3 for mailing and surfing, 5 for streaming, and 7 for editing. And this goes for other specs too: Choose storage size for how many movies, music, documents etc. I want to store, choose RAM size depending on how heavy tasks I'm going to use, choose graphics card depending on what I need for quality and smoothness etc. and DO NOT choose specs depending on what Linux Distro I want to use. 

So *choose your computer and it's specs for Linux like I would on a Windows.*

Is this correct?

PS. My choose of Linux Distro doesn't matter either when choosing specs, correct? Yes of course some would be more demanding, but no one is going to be so much more demanding that I have to upgrade my parts. Correct?

Why do some universities host mirrors of various linux distros?,while I was downloading ISO files for some distros and I see mirrors coming from some universities like waterloo and ubc. Just curious but why?,"Ha! Ex mega-mirror admin and manager here... about 10 years back.

I ran the mirror (now absorbed) for half the known universe a while back.  We were punching out 2TB a day, back when the biggest pipe imaginable was 1GBit.... we had 15TB of RAID5 online storage that was FLOGGED... again, back when 320GB drives were the biggest available.

The answer is MONEY.

People might not know, but major traffic ***exporters*** are paid by ISPs to put their content ***into*** their networks. The reasons are varied, but its a simple case of how ISPs pay each other for traffic (peering).

If the traffic balances, there is no cheque.

But if a shitload of traffic goes INTO an ISP, and that it is out of balance to what is returned (usually there are peering rates), that ISP must write a cheque for the difference.

So, Unis, which were massive suckers of traffic ***into*** their networks needed to find a way to offset the costs. Mirroring is a cheap way to do this.  It helped unis were massive Linux nerds :) :)

In my country, that 2TB per day was handsomely paid for by one of the major ISPs. They even put the two fibre connections in free of charge (bbbiiiiggg $$$) AND paid for 2 cisco routers that were a million bux each.

Times change, so the mirror closed down (an ISP and data centre absorbed it) but at the time it was a major contributor and significant percentage to the ***worlds*** traffic.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I will say, up front, that this is a simplified description, as there were multiple peers, dark fibre, and other non-obvious things occurring, but this explanation is very close to the whole truth.

Why use a different terminal?,"Sorry if I sound foolish (which I probably will, because I'm an amateur Linux user) but why someone changes between terminals? For example, I've been using alacritty for some time and I see no difference between alacritty and the others. I used gnome terminal, urxvt, termite and some others but they feel like they're all same. I use same commands, same keys and they all do the same. Only thing that changes is the prompt and that changes with the shell, as far as I know. I use fish shell and the prompt I choose is applied to every terminal with fish shell. So, what I want to ask is, what's the point of changing terminals? For example, what is the difference between alacritty and gnome terminal or termite? Please enlighten me!","Different terminal emulators have specific features which some may need, like, or not like. 

Since you mentioned Alacritty in particular, it's well known for being a GPU-accelerated terminal. In many workflows this may not be relevant, but some make use of the feature. However, it doesn't natively support tabs, and that may be a big turn-off for others.

If your terminal works for you, or you don't notice a difference in your workflow, continue using it. Linux is all about choice."
What is the most free software and consumer-friendly printer manufacturer?,"From reading other threads, it seems like the situation is tied between HP and Brother printers: HP because they provide excellent GNU/Linux support, and Brother because they allegedly don't use DRM to restrict the ink/toner cartridges that can be used or have otherwise sleazy business practices.

Linux on Public PCs in the Library,"I work in a medium-sized, urban library with 10 public computers available for use. Currently, they're running Windows 10 Home (and it should be Enterprise). We're waiting on some grant money to perform hardware and software updates on the public PCs, partly so that I can upgrade them to Enterprise.

However, technically I'm not supposed to be doing anything. We had a fairly competent tech team run by the state [Edit: the state Library Commission], which was then absorbed into the state's IT department, who are now also responsible for the libraries. They are bad at it. They barely show up to do their jobs, and when they do they half-ass it or break six other things in the process. Thus it has fallen on me to do most of the technical heavy lifting, because I am the most technically proficient. Trouble is, I just really don't have the time to be doing it.

Right now our public PCs have quite possibly the worst setup imaginable for public security; they run Fortres Grande, which prevents patrons from doing anything productive at all, and essentially requires us to deactivate it to read a USB, and Windows is constantly pulling its garbage to attach emails to local accounts and making maintenance generally difficult. Fortres seems to be on the PC to act as a DeepFreeze substitute...but they don't really even remotely work the same way. The company even has software that actually does work that way (Enterprise also allows for this feature by default)! So private information isn't being cleared, and the actual function of the computer is being hindered by our IT's production environment. To make matters worse, currently no image (updated or otherwise) exists of the PCs, so basic maintenance is made even more difficult. Again, I just really don't have the time. But my goal is to move away from relying on the state IT for our needs at all.

In light of Microsoft's continued commodification and zeal for Windows 11 and further intrusive features, I thought I might just skip a step and roll out Linux on our public PCs. If I do it right, barely anyone will be able to even tell it's not Windows.

I'm not really a Linux user. I've dabbled with it, and I've wanted to switch for years, but I've just never made the leap. There are a *lot* of distros, and I'm just not sure which, if any, would be best in this sort of environment. The goal is to have a PC that can perform general basic functions a person might need from a public computer that can be locked down on the backend so the drive is not written to while locked, and patrons restarting the PC will have data erased and reboot to the locked drive state/image. I'm not concerned about setting any of this up (it will be well worth it), just the actual reality of making it happen.

My primary concern is the overall functionality. Because these aren't your average Linux users using the PC, many don't understand what a text editor is or what program they need to view PDFs; they look for the icons and the names, and even functionality—while better in some cases—is not going to be 1:1 with Windows software/formatting. A docx file for example. I'm additionally concerned it would overall add more of a burden on staff who would similarly need to learn these things, and spend more time explaining to patrons how to make Linux software work the way they want it to.

Should I stick with Windows? Am I making mountains out of molehills and Linux might be the solution I need? Any librarians here in the sub, or even just people who have managed similar environments? I would love your thoughts.

tl;dr I'm catering to the lowest common denominator so I'm not sure if a switch to a Linux OS for widespread use is in my best interest, but my IT department is bad and Windows is only making things worse.

Edit: I've spent an unnecessary amount of time justifying my job and my competency to a bunch of internet strangers, which was not the point of the post. I'm marking this Resolved. Thank you to everyone who provided legitimate advice. It's a lot to think about, but gives me some concrete options. Until the worst case scenario with Microsoft, I don't think I'll need them, but it's all very useful.",""" If I do it right, barely anyone will be able to even tell it's not Windows.""

Even if you solved all the issues with file compatibility, you will discover just how much some people are thrown by very slight, very insignificant differences in the interface that you don't even notice. 

If your patrons only used your computers, it would be a hard switch. If they are working on something at home and then come in to make final edits and print it out? It will be high stress for everyone. 

But it would be great. Maybe set up one computer with Linux Mint, somehow clearly marked as different, and see how much use it gets. If it is at capacity, switch another one, and so on, until you are down to one terrible windows machine."

Thinking that I can create a beautiful desktop on my own without much trouble, I try my best to build something of my own. However, after days of experimentation, banging my head against the docs and re-reading the base config file for the 1000th time to understand its logic, I feel conflicted and jealous that some people can create good and functional rices, while I'm stuck with a half-assed, poorly written, absolutely abominable configuration that barely works and the only place for it is the recycle bin. In turn, the ideas I was thining about trying to implement, get thrown away.

What can Linux do that MacOS can’t?,"Hi, everybody! I am a college student majoring in CS and was wondering what values can Linux add while using it alongside MacOS. I’ve been using MacOS for a long time and just because of the fact that MacOS and Linux are similar(given that they are based on Unix), I wasn’t motivated enough to learn Linux. However, more and more of my classes started to require basic knowledge of Linux and I realized that basic linux knowledge is bare minimum requirement in order to excel in the field. Can I get an idea of what makes Linux so powerful/attractive so that only adhering to MacOS isn’t enough? Or is it enough?
Thanks for all your inputs :)","> What can Linux do that MacOS can’t?

It can run on commodity hardware.  It can run on more types of CPUs.  It scale *up* to supercomputers.  It scales down to inexpensive SBCs.

Linux has advanced resource and security controls that allow it to implement containers.  macOS does not.  (If you find yourself thinking ""but Docker Desktop..."", remember that Docker on macOS runs a Linux VM in order to provide those controls.)  Containers are essential to Linux's success in extremely large production networks.  Apple probably is not adding container support because they don't care about macOS as a server platform.  Even Windows supports containers today.  macOS is basically the only common system that doesn't.

macOS is reasonably good at workstation tasks, so most likely the things that Linux does that macOS *cannot* do are going to involve either systems much larger than workstations or much smaller than workstations."

Edit: ok thanks, it seems that it helps preventing brute force attacks.","Because of [this line of code](https://github.com/linux-pam/linux-pam/blob/b872b6e68a60ae351ca4c7eea6dfe95cd8f8d130/modules/pam_unix/support.c#L676).

Should I switch to Linux?,"So I'm starting my programming journey and everywhere I look there's people telling me that Linux is better for coding. Why is that? 

Also I really like gaming, I would need a virtual machine with Windows to play most my games. Does this work well or the games don't run proper?","I think Linux is better for programming, so do a lot of other people, but the only way to know if *you* think it's better is to try it. Also, gaming on Linux isn't bad, and Proton is making it even better. But as I tell everyone else who asks, the only correct answer to ""should I switch?"" is ""try it and see if you like it"" It will probably be a lot of learning, so if you're not up for that, stay on Windows, but just try it. You can read what other people think all day, but it won't be worth anything if you don't have your own opinions as well"
Use Linux as daily OS,"Hello, I recently discovered Linux and it's possibilities, and I loved it. I tried Zorin OS and it is really neat. I'm using a school laptop, and those things are absurdly overpriced, they may have reasonable hardware for eight years ago. So I'd love to 'upgrade' them by using a lightweight OS. But since I use it almost daily for school, and I'm used to Windows, I need to get used to it.

But my main question is, how can I use the elegance and convenience of Linux, with the possibilities of Windows? For example, my school uses OneDrive a lot, how can I connect that with Linux. And how can I use other Microsoft software? Is it possible at all to use Linux if you're dependent on Windows? And what lightweight Linux OS would you recommend?

Fair warning about PearOS: Don't.,"To my distro-hopping friends and lovers of different distros: *Stay way from PearOS NiceC0re.*

The installer **will wipe your whole disk** — EFI partition included — *with absolutely no warning*. 

I don't know how to emphasize this more: It will wipe your whole disk. Everything. Without any warning. 

You select a disk to install to, and expect the next screen to be the partition scheme setup, like almost any other linux distro where you can select ""Entire Disk"", ""Custom Partitions"", ""Replace Partition"" etc. Something like that. 

Not with PearOS. You select the disk, and *boom* it's empty and being installed to. 

If you wanted to dual-boot PearOS with your existing install? Your existing install doesn't exist anymore, sorry. 


This is such a stupid way to do thing, and such a no-no from a UX pov that I'm surprised something like this is publicly shared. This is something that should've been caught in early internal testing, not public builds. 

I expected distros to do this in the ass-end of 1990s, not 2025. 


Thankfully I was testing on one of my testing laptops, but it's still a pain in the ass to install and configure Windows and other distros *again*. Just because this piece of crap has the worst installer in the world.","I just can't understand where do people get these niche trash distros from

Why is Fedora usage so rare?,"Every time I see any reviews or commentary on the experience of using Fedora I only hear good things about how smooth it is, and how great they are at delivering up to date software while remaining stable; however when you start reading around on what people are actually running the most common answer is usually an Arch or Ubuntu-based system. So what's the hold-up with using Fedora or making more Fedora-based distros? Is it because of rpm? Do the Fedora repos not have as much software as Arch or Ubuntu do? I've been having an itch telling me to try and install Fedora on my system for a while but the question of why not that many people do it keeps me from fully commiting to it","it's a solid system with a big community.  Just not a very vocal community in the distro-wars, maybe."
I’m thinking of putting a Linux distro on some free laptops that are being given to some kids in need. The laptops are windows and have past user data on them so I’d put a Linux distro on them. I was thinking of Linux Mint or Raspbian. Do you recommend one?,"They’d use it for whatever kids use laptops for. Schoolwork, browsing, games etc. I guess open office would work for schoolwork. Raspbian has some cool things on it to learn Python and some little games. They wouldn’t know how to update the system unless taught how to though.

What can I do with Linux that I couldn't do with Windows?,I have an old PC in my hands and I installed Lubuntu on it. I'm new to Linux and want to experiment with it.,"You could shut down your computer without your OS forcing an update.

What are some Windows applications that surprised you by running perfectly on Linux?,"Recently I upgraded laptops and have gone through the process of moving everything over to a new install. One thing I noticed is I didn't really have a music player anymore.

I used to use MPD with ncmpcpp but since upgrading to Pipewire that setup has not worked well for me and I don't have the time to mess around to get it going again. So I looked at my options, and frankly none of them worked for me. I decided to try my old favourite from Windows, Foobar2000. To my surprise it works perfectly. This got me thinking... are there any programs from Windows you've tried on a lark that work really well on Linux? They can be proprietary as well.

EDIT: When I say Windows applications, I really mean Windows exclusive. GIMP has a Windows version, but of course it also has a native Linux version so I would exclude it, for example.

EDIT: Was more interested in anything aside from games. It's pretty common knowledge already how awesome Proton is.","Does it have to be ""programs""?

Whats your story?,"So many different walks of life. Whats your story? How did you get into Linux? If you’re a Linux admin or heavily use Linux in the professional world, how did you get to that point?

My story: I started exploring the idea of an IT career path after college (music degree, didnt move to a major city, and wanted a fulfilling career where I could apply skills I had/have). So my father in law gave me an old tower with ubuntu 18 and said “have fun”. I fell in love with linux and the command line and all the possibilities that exist with FOSS and open source. Since then I completed a career program, got a linux certification, and landed my first IT job. I use linux some where I work and its funny because the response I get using the CLI is “is that the stuff from hacker movies?” Or “you know theres a GUI tool for that right?” But theres no shame in that thinking. We all work and think differently. My long term goals are to get into Linux System administration. Theres potential where I’m at to do some small linux system/server management so hopefully that will get me to the next chapter in my IT journey. 

Whats your story?","I wanted to play minecraft, but i had an ancient PC and I'm only 15, so i didn't had money for a new PC. So, i read on the internet that Linux is lightweight, so i installed xubuntu and Minecraft ran better than windows. After some time, i thought about making games and got into coding. Then, i found out that my PC can't handle game engines(not even Godot). I gave up on game development and thought I'll learn it when i grow up and buy a good PC, then i got interested in web development and learnt the basics of Linux terminal. I'm still learning web dev, learnt basic HTML, CSS and I'm trying to learn some JavaScript. That's my story😁"
"If you use shells other than Bash, why?",Wanna get some fresh opinions on why some people would rather use shells other than Bash.,Zsh has nice bells and whistles.
Why aren't more people talking about/recommending openSUSE?,"Serious question here.

The last time I looked at openSUSE was two or three years ago. I had some meh experiences with some repos and just gave up after a day. I never gave it another go as it just doesn't come up all that often when talking about distros on reddit or frankly anywhere.

I've now got a Project at work to upgrade a SLES Cluster and though i could prepare by putting openSUSE on my spare SSD. And to my surprise, it is way better than most other distros i tried so far.

Everyone is takling about how easy Manjaro makes it with all their Tools especially for Kernel and driver stuff. openSUSE blew me away by how easy and flawless YAST installed Nvidia drivers. Only beaten by PopOS which has the drivers out of the box.

I'm running tumbleweed atm. Plasma is probably the smoothes experience i've had with KDE in a LONG time. As up to date as Arch, no hiccups, no major theming like Manjaro does and overall, just a working stock Plasma install with no fuss.

Then i thought ""maybe its a corporate thing"", but no. The Repos contain everything you need for gaming. Steam, Lutris, Discord. All there. LoL on Lutris was even more straight forward than popOS.

Then i had that typical ""but AUR"" argument. Signal Desktop wasn't in the repos and Signal only provides deb packages. I thought i was screwed. But nope. [software.opensuse.org](https://software.opensuse.org) even has user provided packages with a great website and an actuall 1-click install that works without any addons or plugins. All without needing the terminal or a AUR manager or such.

Finally, they install BtrFS by default and have Snapshots set up for anything you do without the User having to configure it (might be a BtrFS thing, i never tried that as no other Distro defaults to it). Great.

So yeah, it's only been a couple of hours, and at the risk of rose tinted glasses (stuff could still go south): Why isn't openSUSE recommended more? It feels like the best of most worlds. Great installer, Awesome default setup, close to as current as Arch with an AUR ""clone"", and even better tools then the Manjaro stuff (imho). Why aren't we as a linux community recommending it more to newcomers or as a ""try that for something new"" for distrohoppers?","The only reason I don't prefer it to arch and arch based distros is because OBS is not as easy and quick as AUR. AUR helpers may not be officially supported, but tools like pamac really make software management a breeze"
Is it worth switching from Windows to Linux?,"Hey! Me and my friend got an idea to switch from Windows to Linux, more accurately Manjaro. So i just thought it would be worth asking more experienced users for pros and cons of Manjaro. What are some major differences between the operating systems?

EDIT: Thanks for all the answers! It was really helpful","Advantages of Windows: MS office, better game support, possibly some drivers

Advantages of Linux (all apply to Manjaro): customizability on every level (get KDE edition if you want an easy graphical desktop tweaking experience), security (generally very little Linux malware is even out there and most of it is broken nowadays), easy access to free (and often actually good) software, online tutorials that treat you like a human being capable of learning.

Disadvantages of Windows: Microsoft spying on you (if you care about that, I personally don't mind), 2 or 3 of every app (internet explorer/edge/chredge, paint/paint3D, settings/control panel), tons of background processes leading to inefficient memory usage, programs from the internet less secure, etc.

Disadvantages of Linux: some games will not work, especially if they use deep-level anti-cheat on Windows. MS-Office documents/projects are mostly supported by LibreOffice, but some formatting incompatibilities may still occur. Many softwares are managed by individuals or small teams with little funding, so Don't count on updates."
Why are some users not fan of SystemD?,"**Hi everyone,**  
As the title suggests, I’ve come across a recurring sentiment on Reddit and other forums where some users mention they’re not fans of **systemd**. I’m curious to understand why that is. If you consider yourself a ""non-fan"" of **systemd**, I’d love to hear your perspective.

  
EDIT: Thank you all very much for your comments. This got more attention than I expected and now I have some interesting views to read. I much appreciate the time you took in writing your comments.","There are a few reasons why some people don't like systemd:

The first is that systemd does a lot more than older init systems, this violates the traditional Unix principle of ""do one thing and do it well"", adherents to to the Unix philosophy hence do not like it. Systemd advocates argue that we should not be so tightly bound to the philosophy of a now dead operating system. I can see where both sides are coming from here, but lean towards systemd for this argument.

The second is that systemd has progressively ""absorbed"" other projects such as udev. Despite this, udev (a program necessary for running a modern Linux system) and these other projects remain functionally distinct, with udev being able to run perfectly well without systemd, they are merely bundled together under one source tree to ""encourage"" the use of each other. Bear in mind that Microsoft got in big trouble in the 90s for bundling their Browser with their Operating System, and were accused of anti-competitive behaviour. Of course, systemd is clearly not doing this for profit, rather it seems the devs of systemd really want people to use systemd and will go to great lengths to encourage its use.

The third problem is that systemd has introduced various features to Linux and have encouraged higher level projects, such as desktop environments to use these features, thus making systemd a dependency of these projects, ensuring that people must use systemd. Because of this, GNOME officially requires systemd to operate (but you can get it to work without systemd with some modifications). In the proprietary world this is known as [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in), and it has been compared Microsoft's underhanded ""[Embrace, Extend, Extinguish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish)"" tactics that landed them in hot water back in the 90s. It is important to note that this is not as bad as what Microsoft did, because systemd is free software, it can always be forked. However it is still pretty clear that the systemd devs haven't played entirely nice here.

The fourth ""reason"" is that the lead developer of systemd, [Lennart Poettering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennart_Poettering) is a colourful character to say the least. He is well known for his controversial opinions, and he is well known for being unapologetic in having them, and has frequently made comments that have rubbed many the wrong way. Systemd has been often desrcribed (or criticised) as becoming the ""core"" operating system in its own right, [something Poettering has certainly **not** denied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2aa34Uzr3c). Poettering is clearly a talented guy, but he's obviously got an ego, and that clearly rubs some people the wrong way."
Is Linux infrastracture ready for mass influx of users?,"So this subreddit is mostly about people coming to Linux and according to [Steam hardware survey](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey) and to [statcounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide), we can say that the usage is rising for Linux a bit. Is Linux network infrastrucure ready for mass users?

In another words, almost all distros rely on package managers. What if the community would experience gradual influx (reasonable, so not something like that all users would switch in one day) of users over a period of time putting a load on these servers? Is the package manager software technology ready for this? Also, would there be enough funding for the servers? Where is the funding for these package managers gathered now anyway?

The ""*would there be enough funding*"" question interests me the most.","Debian has over 300 mirrors. Many are university-based. Fedora is backed by RedHat, which is owned by IBM. I don't think bandwidth costs would be a concern for IBM. The large number of distros also helps to distribute any load that may occur."
"I'm disabled and I'd like to rebind the two thumb buttons on my mouse to control and shift, but neither imwheel or xbindkeys seem to work","My primary use for having them bound to that is control and shift are widely used in combination with the scroll wheel for increasing/decreasing zoom as well as vertical and horizontal movement. As someone with only one working hand these binding are *vitally* important.

With xbindkeys I tried 


    ""xte 'key Control_L'""
     b:8
    
    ""xte 'key Shift_L'""
     b:9

And various permutations of that, but no dice. Doesn't seem to work at all.

With imwheel I've tried variations on 

    Button4,   Thumb1,   Control_L|Button4,   0
    Button5,   Thumb1,   Control_L|Button5,   0
    Button4,   Thumb2,   Shift_L|Button4,     0
    Button5,   Thumb2,   Shift_L|Button5,     0

and 

    None,   Thumb1,   Control_L,    0
    None,   Thumb2,   Shift_L,      0

But again, no luck.  

With the former I know they're firing off but only as soon as I release *both* buttons and the number of times is insane. With the latter it's firing off control or shift, but at *very* rapid speeds, at least 30hz. 

Also, why is the documentation for imwheel so awful?

Does the Linux Kernel have all the devices drivers by default on it?,"I was messing around with an Xbox360 USB controller on Fedora and decided to try and play some games with it, I plugged it in and it just worked fine with no problems, then I tried a more ""obscure"" controller, a Logitech f710 and it also worked so I started wondering, does the Kernel already have the drivers for every single supported device/printer/scanner etc etc etc? Isn't that kind of bloated? Why would I want to have the drivers to 10000000 different things I will never use? Is there any way to make it more modular?",One point not yet made...

Why is audio still so awful on linux?,"Mods, this is basically just a rant, feel free to delete this.

I've been using linux for about 8 years now, and nearly exclusively for the last 4. I've hopped distros quite a few times from ubuntu to mint to arch and now manjaro. I've gotten a number of others to switch to it as well, usually for secondary media PCs and outdated laptops and the such. I'm always happy to help them with any issues they encounter, as they're usually ones I've encountered as well, and quite routine to fix. However, there's one that I basically don't even touch with a ten foot pole to this day.

Audio. I don't know if it's just me, but audio on linux is a neverending nightmare of devices that refuse to populate and esoteric wiki entries that lead to a rabbit hole of dead ends and archived threads from 2012 that link to ""easy fix"" posts that 404'd 4 years ago. Alsamixer is borderline useless almost every time I try to diagnose a missing playback device, and to this day I still don't know how to change playback devices within the CLI-based UI, and I can't tell if that's because I'm thick or because it's dumb.

Yes, I know I can RTFM, and I've tried. Every time I have, however, it's usually just caused me to learn more about the history of PCM audio and compatibility modes, and I'm left technically better off than I was in the beginning, but with a computer that still refuses to play any sounds. 9 times out of 10, the solution the person uses is to choose a different distro that will, SOMEHOW, use its default audio settings to just make it work fine. 

Anyway thanks for listening. Feel free to delete and or downvote, mainly looking to see if anyone else gets as frustrated as I do. I'm gonna go see if I can't get this guy's HDMI audio working again now...","Pulseaudio has significantly improved Linux audio, I haven't had any issues in years."

Is there a good way to trick a Linux game in to thinking it has active focus?,"So I run a game in windowed mode and then I launch another application and give focus to the other application. It appears that most games does a combination of:

 * Slowing the framerate to a crawl
 * Disabling sound
 * No longer listen in to the controller input
 * Stay in ""Paused"" mode

Is there a generic trick I can use to make a game think it still has active focus? I am right now doing everything under X11 so any X11 specific hack is fine for now.

I also noticed that games that use the Unity engine (like Clustertruck and Celeste) don't have this issue, but all the other games do.

My only other alternative is to launch the game via a VM so the game thinks it has focus when it really doesn't but this can really effect focus and I wouldn't be able to launch any Vulkan games via this method.

Why do people dislike Flatpaks?,"So I'm thinking of switching from Windows to Zorin. Zorin has Flatpaks, which to me sound pretty useful, but I've seen a lot of people complain about them.

What's wrong with Flatpaks?","The whole concept of application images / containers changes the core paradigm of software distribution on Linux. Instead of relying / trusting the distribution maintainers you have to trust each and every flatpak provider to keep track of bugs and security issues in all their dependencies. Critical security issue in OpenSSL? Arch, Debian, Fedora maintainers push patched OpenSSL package and all software depending on it is fixed in one go. With flatpak first every flatpak using OpenSSL has to update their used libraries and second you have to update every single flatpak.

Flatpak has a use case for obscure software where the low user count does not justify it getting dedicated distribution maintainers. But IMO it should never be the default way to install software on Linux. IMO it is one step towards the security hell on Windows."
Gentoo Users: Why do you NEED Gentoo?,"What project were you working on that you decided you *needed* Gentoo's infinite customization capabilities? What were you doing that made you say ""I need a source-based distro to do ABCXYZ""?

The fact that Gentoo takes so long to setup and that it's somewhat of a part-time job to maintain, that I can't fathom why a person would pick Gentoo unless they had a specific *need* for the distro.

Do you get more privacy? Do you get better security? Do you get more software? Is it faster? Is it lighter than Arch?

I can think of reasons why you want Gentoo, but I can't think of reasons why you *NEED* Gentoo.

What is your favorite thing about Linux? : ),"Broad question, I know XD . One of the many things that I absolutely love is that, with Linux, you have the ability to learn all of the low level system shenanigans. There's no proprietary blobs of garbage that stop you from learning.

What's your favorite thing? Also good morning : )","Package managers are awesome. No downloading random programs from the internet. Everything updates with one command.

The ability to change the desktop environment/window manager is nice. 

I also like how powerful the basic programs like grep, cat, find, etc can be, especially when chaining them together with pipes. This is definitely the thing that impressed me the most when I first started w/ Linux.

Lastly, being able to have a super lightweight system that takes up minimal disk space and RAM is really nice. My Arch install takes up less than 5GB of disk space and that can be reduced quite a lot if needed. Last time I used windows I think it took at least 15GB, before updates or installing other things. My RAM usage upon booting is ~300MB, and that's actually a lot higher than normal I think.

There's a lot of things, I could probably write about my love of Linux all day lol."
Did Linus really write the first iteration of Linux using machine code?,"I watch Linus give a talk where he said he programmed in machine code instead of assembly. How would I hypothetically do this? Could I open a text editor today and write hexadecimal instructions and then change the file extension to run my code?


Bonus points if Linus Torvalds himself is on Reddit.","The first public release of Linux contains a smattering of x86 assembly for bootstrap, interrupt and exception handling, system call entry, and hardware access. This is necessary as C simply doesn't have any concept of any of these things. C code runs in a vacuum and assumes that _actually doing stuff with hardware_ is Somebody Else's Problem.

The rest of the codebase is C. I'd estimate that no more than about 5% of Linux 0.01 is written in assembly.

In practical terms, there's practically no reason anybody needs to deal with machine code rather than assembly nowadays. It doesn't make sense unless you're literally toggling in your bootstrap loader through the computer's front panel... and that hasn't been needed for over 40 years. So it's possible Linus may have fiddled around with machine code, but it's certainly not a prerequisite for writing an OS. I have no reason to believe it was ever done during Linux's early development.

> Could I open a text editor today and write hexadecimal instructions and then change the file extension to run my code?

So there's a couple of problems with this.

Machine code is just a sequence of byte values. Hexadecimal is a way for programmers to _visualise_ and _represent_ byte values, but it isn't the byte values themselves. Typing hex into a text editor isn't going to do anything useful.

Second, a modern Linux executable consists of far more than just the machine code that makes up the program. There is a whole bunch of stuff to tell the OS which bits of the executable need to be loaded into RAM, what other libraries need to be linked into the process image, and where the code actually starts.

If you use a more minimal operating system you can do what you're thinking about. COM files on DOS were literally just a process image, with the first instruction executed right at the start of the file."
Why are people so obsessed over “the hot new linux”distribution?,"IMHO, once you’re advanced enough in linux, you can accomplish the same thing on virtually ANY linux distro. So, if that’s the case why are people so obsessed with promoting niche distros as a new fad when there wil never be a one size fits all distro that will be tailored to your needs out of the box? It’s up to you to personalize it and make it really your own, which is the beauty of linux! 

Sorry for the small rant, but I can’t stand when people are promoting new distros that are more of a security risk than a functional linux distribution.","What else is there to discuss in a casual Linux community?

"Parents, do you let your kids use Linux?","When I was a kid, my parents got us a PC with Windows on it. That was my first real dive into computers—I learned how to navigate the system, install software, tweak settings, and, of course, install games.

Now that I think about it, what if I had grown up with Linux instead? Would I have learned more about how computers work under the hood? Would I have been forced to troubleshoot and explore more deeply? Maybe I’d have picked up command-line skills much earlier.

So, for the parents out there: do you introduce your kids to Linux? If so, how has the experience been for them? Are they curious about how the system works, or do they find it frustrating?

So i got Linux for the first time in my life...,"I had a laptop from 2016 with a ton of problems, and decided i should give Linux a try.

I started with a google search, found out Linux is not actually Linux, but Linux is in fact a ton of different Linuxes, so i did a bit of research and installed Ubuntu.

After a bit i came across a image, which said Ubuntu actually used TWICE and much memory as Mint Cinnamon, i instantly believed this sketchy picture and instantly dropped everything i had and installed that instead.

So I'm currently running the latest Mint Cinnamon work-space...?

Anyways,

My memory of Linux, is a Linux penguin game i played back in the early 2000s, i had no idea how far it had come.

So I've set everything up, i actually managed to FIX MY DAMN GPU ISSUES (It would never run above 500MHz for some reason)

I got my apps ready, i made the change from Chrome to Firefox, and I feel satisfied with what I've done so far...

So now my paranoia is taking over, have i forgot something? The terminal is amazing, but, what is a MUST KNOW? (Beside shortcut to open and how to type codes people have made on the internet)

Should i just continue as normal? Are there any hidden features that will bite me in the ass unless I'm prepared?

Anything i NEED to know?","The only thing you need to know I would say is that Linux is not Windows. This is an important thing to consider because even though it looks alike, and on the surface functions alike, the underlying system is completely different. 

When people run into issues they can become very frustratred because they expect Linux to work like Windows. Fact of the matter is that you are going to need to learn a completely new operating system and need to approach Linux as completely different from Windows. You’re going to have trouble with stuff that’s ‘very simple’ to fix in Windows but this is not because Linux is complex or difficult per se but rather because it’s a whole new system. 

There’s more than enough online documentation and I’d advice you to learn along the way. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes and to mess things up. This will happen so use backups. 

Other than that just have fun with it."
Why does everyone hate Java applications?,"I see it generally everywhere I go as a Linux user: almost everyone has some kind of problem with Java applications. I understand Java as a development platform has some rather infuriating holes regarding its deployment methods, and the most common issue I've seen are memory leaks and just how memory hungry the applications can be by themselves.

Is it a concept of purity? Or is is just because of some other reason that seems to escape me? I use some Java applications almost daily without problems. So why the grudge?

Opinions, rather than absolute answers, are expected.

**Resolved** \-- Technically, there have been several wonderful and informative answers here on this post. Some answer the question better than others. However, not one singular answer is fitting enough to answer this question, so I thank everyone who took the time out of their day to enlighten me about Java and its rather unfortunate history. Thanks again!","Java has it's good points (it runs everywhere), but the flip side is it feels clunky. Standard Java apps don't use any OS specific things. That means it doesn't accept your GTK themes, your KDE themes, it doesn't integrate well with any system service.

I think Java just feels clunky, and it's largely because if you want an app that runs everywhere then it nessicarely can't integrate with anything, it can't be optimized to any system, and it needs to follow its own rules so it doesn't work well with any OS.

Now it doesn't have to be, I've see Java apps that use the native libraries, but they were not cross platform."

I realize this likely has nothing to do with Hyprland but I need an answer to what happened here. I just made 3 major changes: I upgraded from Ubuntu 24.04 to 24.10, which came with Wayland, and I decided to try Hyprland.

Computer wakes from sleep at 11 past the hour no matter what,"My machine is getting to me. I'm half convinced it's haunted. 

So, when I go to bed, I tend to put my workstation to sleep. I try to go to bed before 1. Recently, however, if I put my machine to sleep before 1, the machine will wake up at _exactly_ 1h11. Tonight, I went to bed _after_ 1h15, so I thought it would be solved. NOPE! it woke up at 2h11, and kept me up until I realised it was on and put it back to sleep at 5h56, when it then decided to wake up again… at 6h11. When it wakes up on its own, it is always at Xh11. To my knowledge, I do not have Wake-on-LAN enabled, and I do not have a wired connection anyway.  

Most other people have the problem of a computer waking up immediately after it goes to sleep. Why would my machine only wake up at 11 past the hour?

EDIT: OK, so I found a solution! If I just disable everything in /proc/acpi/wakeup, it doesn't wake up every hour! It also doesn't wake up when I push the sleep button on my keyboard… which is also the power button… This is not the total solution.

EDIT 2: I'm going in order, slowly enabling wake-up events to find the culprit. Since they take an hour each to check, I'd like to figure out what they do. I had to disable XCH0, XCH1, UAR1, PXTH, GPP0, GPP1, GP17 and GP18. I know XCH are the 3.1 ports, and UAR1 is the UART serial port. Can anyone enlighten me on the others?

EDIT 3: ~~OK, so it seems that with my hardware setup, All but GP18 are non-related.~~ 

EDIT 4: It is gone. I am scared. I turned this machine off and on again and it went away, even though that hasn't stopped it before. Perhaps an application I was running was the cause?

EDIT 5 ITS FUCKING BACK AND AT A NEW TIME I THINK IF IT KEEPS UP WITH THIS I AM THROWING THIS BEIGE PIECE OF SHIT INTO THE SAINT LAURENT

EDIT 6: The evil has been vanquished for now. Disabling XHCI in /proc/acpi/wakeup was what did it.","Check your [systemd logs](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/132115/how-to-find-reason-a-notebook-wakes-up). It should show for what reason it woke up.

You can either disable wake for an event/device with acpitool -W, or echoing the device name to /proc/acpi/wakeup"
What was wrong with X that motivated Wayland?,"I think I read somewhere that the code base had become unmaintainable. As X has a spec, why didn’t they rewrite it from scratch with a more modern language such as Rust or a newer version of the C++ language and a better organized code base instead of writing something entirely brand new?","I don't think the long-term maintainability of X is really a major reason for Wayland. After all, Xorg _is_ still being maintained.

But there are other reasons for Wayland:

* Security in X is largely non-existent. Any client can modify any window on the display, or eavesdrop on events on any window. This is really fundamental in the design of X &mdash; it's how window managers work, how programs that let you define hot keys work, and so on. Things like [`devilspie`](http://www.nongnu.org/devilspie2/) are only possible _because_ of X's lax security.

* X is not a good fit with how modern graphics hardware works. A lot of X was designed with the idea that 2D graphical primitives would be hardware-accelerated (stippled lines, oh my!). That may have been the case in the 90s... not so much now. Modern hardware doesn't even bother accelerating those things.

* While the supposed network transparency of X is often lauded, it really doesn't work very well over anything with a bit of latency. The X protocol is quite chatty, and a lot of operations require synchronisation between client and server.

* X has a lot of legacy cruft that can't be removed. The core X protocol isn't even used by most X applications using modern toolkits (they typically use the XRender extension instead), but the core X protocol _needs_ to be there because it's literally ""the core X protocol"", and there _are_ a few programs that do use it. Heck, my day-to-day text editor uses Motif and still relies on the core X protocol.

* A lot of hacks on X are _really_, _really_ bad hacks. I'm amazed that [drag and drop](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Draganddropwarts/) ever works at all.

I should add that there _have_ been a few successes in removing the most egregious parts of X. X has historically had hardware drivers in userspace &mdash; it couldn't actually rely on the most useful features of your hardware having kernel APIs, right? &mdash; but as you can imagine that's a terrible idea all round. It's the reason X had to be run as `root`. But a lot of those hardware drivers have been removed now.

Xorg also once had a print server. After all, if you can render a window to a screen, why not also use the same code to render paper documents? Xprint was only removed [after somebody added support for it to `glxgears`](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=558)..."
it's illegal to remove Microsoft Windows from school computers?,"Have been reading these blog posts:

Does Linux actually improve performance?,In a lot of reddit discussions i have seen claims that Linux supposedly offered much greater performance on older AND newer systems. Are these claims true? Or is it just baloney?,"Here is a single data point from our development environment: When we build our C++ code base in Windows it takes at least twice as long compared to building in WSL on the same machine. On some machines I have even seen 4 times faster. 

The problem with windows in this case is spawning new processes, which is really slow on windows, especially with a virus scanner activated, which is mandatory in our corp. Git and the c++ compilers love spawning sub processes for everything, so that is why Windows is slow for our use case.

„Funny“ addendum: We also compile for windows platform with clang-cl, and run the unit tests in wine. Still faster than building and running on windows. And we already have exemptions in our Virus Scanner."
It's 2022. Is programming professionally in the terminal worth trying out?,"So, I'm in my early 30s. I like the terminal. I'm comfortable with a CLI. I started writing programs in notepad, then graduated to notepad++, back in the day.

Now, I've been using vs code for over a year at work, and use it for school. Have never tried any proper ides since I've learned enough to actually use them properly, but I code in dotnet and unfortunately visual studio isn't on Linux. Tbh, I like my pimped out code editor, I'm not sure I even want an ide, but maybe one day.

But that's not the topic of this post. I'm curious, do any of you code professionally in the terminal, and terminal only? I have a friend whose father is a software dev, real old school, and he works professionally still from the terminal. Never leaves it when developing apparently (other than for the internet of course). He says he uses zsh and sets up crazy neo vim environments for the languages and technologies he uses and quite literally does everything in the terminal. This is a guy working for a company in silicone valley.

My question is, is anyone else doing this? Is there something I could gain by doing this over using vs code or an ide? Die hard terminal junkies seem to honestly swear by it. And I'm wondering, are they crazy or are they the ones who actually have it all figured out?","I know an old-school full-stack programmer who wouldn't use anything other than vim, and does well with it. Their .vim file is crazy complex though.

I do all my programming in the terminal, but I write glue scripts, so 'single files' rather than 'projects', which may be easier overall. I'm comfortable in the terminal because it's where I spend most of my technical day.

Explain like I'm 5: What's GNU?,"New Linux user here, many times people say GNU/Linux, I know Linux that it's the kernel but what's GNU","The gnu project maintains [a lot of different software projects](https://www.gnu.org/software/#allgnupkgs).

Some of those are more or less ""ordinary applications"" you might use or not use...for example [gnu octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) or [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/).

But some of the software projects are essential for a working system. The most essential project is probably [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/). Every unix system needs a libc...and on gnu/linux distros that one is from the gnu project. The libc on your system is what pretty much every program uses to do ""basic"" tasks like writing files, getting time, controlling processes and threads, dealing with standard input/output, pipes...The libc either provides that functionality or redirects the request to the kernel in a unified way. It's really the most basic library in your system used by almost everything.

Also every system needs a shell...and the standard in linux is [gnu bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), a shell needs a basic set of commands like `ls`, `cp`, `mkdir`...and the standard there is [gnu coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/).

On the development level gnu provides a [compiler](https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/) for several programming langauges, provides [autotools](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/) used by many projects to deal with compiling for different target systems, provides the [default make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) implementation for the actual compile runs...

Most of the tools gnu provides have alternatives...but there isn't one project that provides all the functionality gnu has, you usually have to take stuff from many different projects to get something close. You can't have a working system without gnu or one of the alternatives. So lots of the tools gnu provides are the defacto standard on linux systems."

[Serious] I am incredibly skilled with windows but prefer linux (obviously haha) I've had such problems out of windows with a few (older) family members I am seriously considering migrating them to Ubuntu linux. Has anyone done this before? If so what are the ramifications?,"Edit: I was more than a bit mad earlier sorry if I typed a bit weird, anger can do that to me.

I am a network/sysadmin working towards exclusively working with redhat servers.

Today I almost blew a gasket, no fault of my family members. I'll tell that story at the end of this.  I'm also not here to debate whether I should give someone \[flavor\] vs ubuntu. Ubuntu is clearly the better option for the computer illiteracy of the people in question.

Has anyone done this and what problems have you ran into?

While attempting to remote into my grandmothers computer (3 hours away and COVID) I simply...couldn't. Here is the problem: Before leaving I set up quick assist AND team viewer. I can't remember the exact phraseology that came up but it was something along the lines of ""server host not responding"" I could get to the 'server' (both cases) so it wasn't the server that was the issue.

This happened to both team viewer and quick assist. So I went through and just had her shut off all security features. NOPE. I was supposing maybe I sat it up so that only my laptop could get through but I didn't have it on me but clearly not the case. Doing this took over 1 hour due to her illiteracy (not her fault she is an old woman) as she doesn't even know what ""right click"" is and would regularly confuse that with left click and 'not know' which to use (IMO that confuses me as she has used computers for most of her life)

Turns out: Windows update LITERALLY broke it. Broke what? Who knows. But anything going over port 3389 is screwed.

As in to the point that I couldn't walk her through fixing it. The 'three' primary answers on Microsoft forums for solving the issue with quick assist were:

1. Uninstall and reinstall quick assist. YOU CAN'T. As in the people who work for Microsoft are asking me to do the literal impossible on their systems. HOW CAN THIS BE THE CASE? How can they possibly not know you cannot do this? It doesn't come up to uninstall. Technically I could have gotten her to uninstall it using her anti-virus but...
2. The second solution was to update it via the Microsoft Store. Now maybe it exists in the Microsoft store, but searching for it doesn't bring it up. SO AGAIN A MICROSOFT HELP DESK EMPLOYEE WRITING KB ARTICLES ISN'T EVEN AWARE OF THIS. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?
3. The third solution offered by Microsoft is to, and get this shit, open Regedit to 'enable it.' THIS SHOULDN'T BE SOMETHING I'M WALKING SOMEONE THROUGH VIA PHONE REMOTELY ...EVER.
4. Soft solution being""Roll back"" the windows update. This one was funny to me. We did it, and it didn't fix the problem.

This isn't to mention the fact that no one else had a functioning solution online. Don't get me wrong all of the solutions I found surely fixed SOMEONES problem with it but not mine. Where as on linux I could have just sent her ""Type in this command verbatim"" over text and been done with it.

I think everyone I support (family/friends) for free is going to have to migrate to linux or lose my support. I'm done with this. I'm absolutely fucking done with windows entirely. I'm VM'ing it from this point forward and just forgetting about it if I don't play video games. Hell I'm even considering moving back to console. I feel like I'm working on some edge version of windows '97 pre release edition where not everything is working and Microsoft wants the kinks worked out or some shit when I'm using windows 10 anymore.

Edit: I have fewer problems from third party drivers on my own system than I do with windows 10. One day I might re-hash the saga of getting my headset to work with discord and giving up and deciding to just VM windows and use Discord on linux.

Why do Linux graphics feel so choppy/laggy(to me?) when compared to Windows?,"Hello.

How are you all?



So, any ideas if there is a way improve that? Or is it just how Linux behaves?

I understand most drivers on Windows are made by huge companies, and they probably way have the upper hand, but I still find it a lot worse.



I KNOW from experience Linux is very fast, free of bloat(I love Arch, and I like Manjaro... don't hate me), yet the graphics side of things REALLY put me off to use Linux as a Desktop.



I've used AMD graphics, Intel and NVIDIA. And not much of a difference to me.



Is this only my perception?

This specially bothers me when moving windows, resizing, etc., which I do quite a lot.



Windows feels a lot faster and smoother.



I also notice the choppiness on macOS under some apps.



Thanks!","HOLY COW.

OpenSuse as a replacement for CentOS,"Hey, as we know, RedHat kicked us hard with pulling the plug on CentOS. I was wondering, can we consider Opensuse Leap as a viable alternative? They're both RPM based, and although I've never used Leap myself, I guess it's quite stable? What do you think, from both desktop and server use cases?

Edit: Seems the consensus is to use Suse/RHEL instead of CentOS in enterprise workloads, and I agree. Cloud Linux seems like a viable option too. I've yet to find problems with OpenSuse, however I haven't tested it to scale, so can't say. Thanks everyone :)","I used SuSE in the enterprise. Let me share my experience with you about working with them at the Enterprise level.

First off, my company - which at the time was a Fortune 20 company (triple digit billions in revenue), and we picked SuSE SLES over RHEL.  Primarily because of the support and licensing model. Also because they said that SuSE will run down any compatibility issues with independent software vendors that claim their code would run on ""Redhat but not SuSE"" - that was part of our support arrangement, and we never had to engage it. It just never happened.

Same thing with hardware support - anything certified that would run Linux should also support SuSE. We had one (1) single issue, and it was an oddball thing running physical baremetal OS on an HP blade environment.  Something to do with multipath drivers for storage, if memory serves. They got it worked out for us.

OK, That's SLE, but OP is asking about OpenSuSE. OpenSuSE is a downstream derivative from SLE. There may be some proprietary / license things that SuSE doesn't include in Open, but from a kernel and update perspective, it's solid. 

Since there's no cost for Open, I would go grab it and play with it. You won't regret it. Go set up a VM and kick the tires on it."

What is a Linux distribution?,"Hey guys,
This is not a troll question. I'm learning all I can about about Linux.
From what I read, Linux is an OS which comprises :
- The bootloader
- The kernel
- The init system
- Daemons
- Graphical Server
- Desktop environment

I watched a video on YouTube where the guy said ""the distribution is only the starting point"" because once you install a distribution, you can then change the graphical server (x, wayland?) and the desktop environment (gnome, kde, xfce). So why does choosing a distribution matter? Does a distribution only provide ""defaults"" as to theme and desktop environment? I feel like they must provide more than this. Could you guys help me out please?","Technically speaking Linux is just a kernel and nothing more. It translates system calls from applications to the low-level hardware signals using hardware drivers, plus manage RAM and some other basic abstractions for file-systems, networking etc.

Distribution on the other side is the set of programs and system configurators packed with Linux kernel.

For me the main difference between distributives are following:

1. Init system: SystemD, InitV, OpenRC, Upstart etc. This is responsible for managing system services and start the whole system up.

2. Package manager: yum, dnf, apt, pacman, etc. This is vital part as that basically describes system package format and how you are going to manage (install/update/delete) packages in your system and who is taking care about resolving dependencies.

3. Default DE. KDE, Gnome, XFCE, etc. There is no much value in installing Ubuntu and then manually removing Gnome and installing KDE, for that I'd prefer to download Kubuntu with everything preinstalled out of the box. Of course you will need to add some more applications of your choice, but at least you don't need to completely remove existing DE in order to replace it with something else.

The rest is just minor differences you can ignore.

P.S. Speaking about XOrg and Wayland, unfortunately Wayland isn't quite ready for everyday usage. Too much work still require to make it shine to its full brightness :)"
What is something that the Windows kernel does better than Linux?,"I asked myself what the Windows kernel is better in. It could be a function, some design choice and so on.

It's a technical and rather broad question, however it would be very interesting to know some expert's opinion on this topic.

Also, due to the closed source nature of Windows in general, I know it is difficult to answer: excuse me if I made a non-sense question.","When the Linux kernel runs out of memory, it eventually [starts killing processes](https://superuser.com/a/536922).

When the Windows kernel runs out of memory, it eventually [stops allocating memory](https://superuser.com/a/569510).

Both of these can lead to erratic and unpredictable behavior. It's likely things will start crashing either way.

**Edit:** Sorry, you asked which is better. I think Windows wins here because applications with static memory usage will continue to function, while Linux might come along and kill a process that was otherwise fine."
What is the one tool that you use one linux that you wish you learned how to use years ago?,"This is very very generic, but here are some guidelines:

\- Also all VCS is good, no need to mention one, but if one particular tools improved your vsc work flow I will be happy to learn about it.

\- Productivity tools are very very welcome.

  
**Edit1**: spelling mistakes  


  
**Edit2**:  
The general consensus is the one tool collection every one should learn (assuming they are already comfortable with terminals) is sed+awk. I admit I never used any of them.  
There is also a general consensus that people wished they knew about ctrl+r in shell where it helps you to search history. I never felt the need for it since I was on zsh already.   
But that reminded me of my favourite shortcut that works on most shells: ctrl+u. That one clears the whole line, extremely useful when you are in the middle of typing password and you think you made a mistake, you can either hit backspace for arbitrary number of times, or ctrl+u",Finally buckled down and read the consise book on AWK. Then I learned some Sed to be conversant. Combine these two with pipes and you can do almost anything from the command line to extract and massage data.
Do you use antivirus on linux? If not why?,"On windows its almost necessary but almost no one is using a antivirus on linux, so is Linux have security measures of some sort? Because what i know that once you give sudo permission to something like , `sudo apt install vim` it can do anything if its malicious so how do deal with this without an antivirus?","Your question is quite good.

In the past, desktop Linux systems have not been of interest for attackers to the best of my knowledge. (Low market share, mostly.)

The most prominent attack against Linux desktop users I am aware of were hacked ISOs of [Linux Mint](https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=2994).

If antivirus increases or decreases your security is debated to this day, with no clear answer to the best of my knowledge.

I have never used antivirus on Linux systems I control, only clamav to scan for Windows viruses in some files.

I never had problems, which could be dump luck, but I guess if you follow some basic rules, your attack surface on Linux is comparatively small:
- Foolish assumption: The Linux desktop market is too small and fragmented to be of interest for serious hackers (outside of proof of concepts)
- I always keep my browser up to date and use ublock origin 
- I use mostly repositories of the distribution and try to only use well maintained/well known 3rd party repositories if necessary.
- I don't download random binary files from the internet and open them
- As a last line of defense (never needed so far) I have my most important files encrypted and have backups of my most important files online/offline

If something has access to repositories that your distribution trusts, you are seriously out of luck. The same is true for all operating systems: All trust at least their company servers (windows update, apple store, ...), there are plenty of stories of malware to infect developer machines and then using for example the apple store to get distributed (google XCode Ghost for an example).

Long story short: If an attacker gets your supply chain (like hijacking an install script of vim in your example), you are totally out of luck and no antivirus will help you. That is to the best of my knowledge true for all operating systems. I would further guess, having the programs which are potential attack vectors (browsers, anything which has network connections, programs you use to open files) up to date is much more important than having antivirus software, as long as you are conservative and don't execute random files from unknown sources.

Just as an anecdote: I always enabled Windows Defender and never had a true positive Virus in 20 years using Windows, by following the basic rules outlined above.

Excuse the novel - English is not my first language and I am too tired to answer more to the point. Hope it helps!

Edit: One important point I forgot to mention: Of course, switch on your firewall on the Linux desktop and deny all incoming requests. Especially when running something from the Debian family, apt starts services with default settings automatically."
Can I adopt discontinued OSs?,"I found a OS with a really nice idea that was discontinued in 2007, and i didnt find anything about the devs. can i adopt the OS, upgrade it and republish it with the same name?

How can I set up a Linux machine to run a single GUI program without needing a DE?,"I help out this museum with computer stuff. They have a few machines that run Google Earth with just a joystick plugged in to control it.

Any help would be greatly appreciated","This is called a ""kiosk""-mode. I'm not familiar by this myself, but perhaps you can use XDM to automatically start X at boot, and then add `exec google-earth-command-thingy` at the end of .xinitrc, as [described by the Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xinit#Starting_applications_without_a_window_manager). I think this should make it so that as soon as you're logged in it'll just run the application, and when the application quits (or crashes) you'll be back at the XDM login screen. Perhaps you can setup XDM to automatically log you in, or maybe you can customize it to just say ""press here to start"" as a login prompt without password?

There are some tutorials if you search for kiosk linux, but I don't know how up to date they are."

Your question fits better in /r/linux4noobs though, try asking there next time, also people there are friendlier.

So, the first thing you should know is that there are many distributions of Linux by different companies and groups of enthusiasts.

The most popular distribution is [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), though I would recommend [Pop!_OS](https://system76.com/pop) because it's based on Ubuntu, but has some useful tweaks like videocard switching for laptops with 2 graphic adapters (NVIDIA Optimus/PRIME).

Or [Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/), which is also based on Ubuntu, but looks a bit more like Windows.

Or [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) if you prefer the look and feel of MacOS. You can enter 0 in the price field and download it for free, it's just a confusing way to ask for donations.

[Guide: Migrating to Linux in 2020

To try Linux you can use a virtual machine such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), or you can write a LiveCD image to a CD or to a USB flash drive (I suggest using [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) as it's the easiest way), then boot from it and use Linux without even installing it on your PC.

If you find your experience worth it, you can install Linux alongside Windows. You will be asked how you want it during installation. That way you can choose which system you want to use every time you turn on your computer."

"Linux ""cured"" my hard disk. Can someone explain me how?","Hello everyone.
Since i bought my laptop (an Acer Aspire E5) i've had issues with my hard disk, which was making a very subtle, super low volume buzzing noise. I know that hard disks tend to make noises due to their mechanical work, but that, as low as it was, was not normal.
 I was using W10 as my OS, and was suffering from a known bug that made my disk usage go up to 100% all the time.
I now switched to Pop OS, clean install, and all the problems went away. No noises, no abnormal disk usage, and my computer is faster than ever.
I can't find anything like that online. How did that happen? I cannot thank the developers enough for bringing my laptop back to life

Edit: Thanks a lot, everyone! For those wondering, i didn't have any suspicious or invasive software, just malwarebites and roguekiller which i used from time to time. I did a clear install of W10 twice, but that didn't solve the problem. I am more than happy using linux, i wanted to switch anyway. It's just better for me.

"In 1998, Windows-98 used to run with as little as 16MB of RAM, whereas today even a lighter distro such as Xubuntu consumes at least 250MB at rest, can someone technically inclined explain to me what accounts for this bloat?","Now, I understand that linux is multi-tasking and a more secure OS, but hey, even Unix was that in the good old days, and even that didn't eat 250MB, did it? So, why does Xubuntu have to eat about 15 times more RAM, is it because of systemd?","A 16x16 pixel icon in 256 colours needs 256 bytes...I think that was the standard in win98 times. A 32 x 32 icon in truecolour needs 4kb...that's 16 times...

A fullscreen picture for 800x600 in truecolour needs 1.8 Mb (without alpha 1.4mb), a fullscreen picture 1920x1080 needs 8mb (without alpha 6mb), 4 times the size...

A simple 16x16 bitmaps for a letter (non anti-aliased, single colour..so not that useful in realitly...but still useful to demonstrate the differences to back then) needs 32 bytes. So a full set of letters for 256 ascii characters (ignoring control chars) needs 8kb. Approximate current number of letters in unicode...135000...so for a full set...about 4mb. (But really just meant as example for the difference is data size we face nowadays...almost nobody uses bitmap fonts anymore)

What I try to say is that sure, code got more complex and we probably waste a bit on it as well....but compared to the data payload changes we had in the last 20 years it's negligible. You have no problem running a linux text only interface in less than 16mb even nowadays...still done in plenty of embedded devices. But you can not compare any gui interface with back then...the background picture you probably use right now alone uses up more memory than the whole OS back then. And we have large screen sizes nowadays...somewhere the memory to keep your windows buffered has to come from. 

And that is even completely ignoring modern UI practices like having ""responsive"" interfaces with animations where all animation phases of buttons have to be kept in memory all the time to react quickly if the mouse hovers something.

I for sure don't want to defend stuff like electron apps nowadays...there are plenty of really wasterful ways to use resources.

I'd love to have some better way of knowing everything I've done and how to undo it to my system in the event something randomly doesn't work and have no idea what caused it. Does something like this exist? Can I silo off everything into its own folder? I'm aware of python virtual environments but I'd love to be able to sandbox everything the same way (and connect sandboxes to another when necessary).

School requires an app that is available for EVERYTHING except linux - what can I do?,"My school requires me to use Clevershare (from Clevertouch; Electrical blackboard manufacturer) so I can connect with the blackboard in my school. Connecting via HDMI is not possible since ALL HDMI ports are completely broken except for one that works every minute or so for 2 seconds.
This app is available for literally EVERYTHING - macOS, Windows, Android, ChromeOS, iOS - except for Linux. I already tried it unsuccessfully with Wine. I heard that I could install Android apps on Linux but the android app doesn't have some features that are absolutely necessary for desktop (only sharing one window for example). Another thought of mine was to kind of modify the ChromeOS app so I could install it on Linux because ChromeOS kind of basically is linux. The board runs Android although I cannot install any other apps that the manufacturer wants you to (source of that information: my teacher). I already have tried Deskreen but that is absolutely horrible since that board's browser is almost unusable for such an application.

What other options do I have? Thank you in advance!

**Update**

Thank you for all these great responses and recommendations.
Here's what I'm gonna do:

1. Try to connect to the board with the application installed on Bottles because I obviously do not own such a board.

2. Try Waydroid to see if that would work.

3. Mirror to my phone (Android) and then from my phone over to the board.

what does the linux kernel actually do and what's the role of the distribution. Can you use linux without a distribution ?,the title sums up the question,"A kernel is the mediator between hardware and programs. Imagine each program accessing the sata bus to instruct harddisks to write data to a harddisk...that is bound to run into collisions and a total mess up. So applications are not allowed to have direct hardware access but instead have to ask the kernel to do it for them. The kernel then can coordinate the hardware access and make sure no programs interferes with the requests of other programs like writing to the same physical position on a harddisk. Then it hands the requests to the actual drivers (also part of the kernel usually) which do the hardware access (Different driver because hardware can differ in how to exactly ""talk"" to it).

The kernel alone isn't really useful..if you just boot the kernel through UEFI you will end up pretty much with a brick. Without any programs requesting functions from the kernel a kernel doesn't really do anything meaning-full. At the very least you need some program that allows user input and does something with it (like a shell).

But you usually also need a lot user-space libraries to make a useful system. While I said that programs ask the kernel that is usually not directly true. In almost all cases programs ask some library to do work for them and that library ""translates"" those requests into kernel syscalls. In theory programs could ask the kernel directly but the kernel interface it rather rudimentary and most programs simply need a more feature full interface. Easy example could be time related stuff. The kernel provides access to the build in clock of your motherboard but programs usually want timezone management, work in year/month/days/minutes/seconds and such ""comfort"". In most linux distros that is provided by the gnu userspace (mainly glibc but there are other important userspace libraries as well). There are alternatives to gnu but they usually don't provide the same level of functionality so the vast majority of distros use the gnu userspace."

Is it possible to export your distro as it is to an ISO file?,"Hello everyone. I've been primarily running PopOS for about a year now, and it's a great distro, but I really don't like the Gnome desktop environment. I was able to take Gnome out and replace it with KDE, and installed a number of programs that don't come pre-installed with Gnome, and I got to thinking; is it possible to export this distro that I've customized myself as an ISO, flash that to a USB drive, and have it ready to reinstall everything with my customizations if I ever need to? 

I'm actually planning on moving out of the Ubuntu/Debian environment and into an Arch-based distro in the near future, so having something like this would be a really big help if I ever decide to go back to PopOS, or even install it to another computer. If need be, I wouldn't mind reinstalling a clean copy of PopOS and setting up all of my customizations one more time just to make sure there isn't any bloat or outdated stuff I wouldn't need. 

Thank you in advance!",The problem you may run into is that your image will likely be out of date and need lots of updates by the time you need to use it.

One of my hobbies is Wireless Networking in Linux, and one of the things that bothers me is that there is no place on reddit for Linux WiFi-related support, and it seems to have been spread across different subreddits such as r/linuxquestions, r/linuxhardware, r/linux4noobs etc.

I have created a new subreddit, r/linuxwifi, in the hopes of organizing a community to support & discuss Linux Wireless Networking and provide support to those who have issues in installation, operation etc.

We have created multiple [troubleshooting posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxwifi/comments/lp6l5i/troubleshooting_wireless_cards_read_before_posting/) which go through the main troubleshooting steps in debugging a failing network card in Linux, and we plan to create a Wiki.

What caused you to initially switch to Linux ?,"I’ll start, it was 100% windows switching the calendar to outlook. ( Tell me why I need to have an internet connection to view my damn calendar ) as well as the incessant way co-pilot was rammed down your throat.","it was actually the whole windows 10 forced updates thing that first pushed me to try linux. nothing quite like being in the middle of a 12-hour reverse engineering session only to have windows decide ""hey time to restart for updates!"" and kill all my work >\~<

started with ubuntu but quickly got frustrated with how locked down everything felt. ended up on gentoo because i'm apparently a masochist who enjoys spending 6 hours compiling chromium just to have complete control over every compile flag

but i still keep windows around on a dual boot because honestly? a lot of the good reverse engineering and game hacking tools are still windows-native. ida pro, cheat engine, some proprietary debuggers... plus when you're analyzing windows malware you kinda need to run it in its native environment sometimes.

the real breaking point was when microsoft started shoving cortana and later copilot down everyone's throats. like i'm already paranoid enough about opsec when doing security research - i don't need my os constantly listening and sending data to microsoft servers :P

gentoo gives me that perfect control freak environment where i can optimize everything for my specific hardware and use cases, while windows handles the stuff that just works better there. best of both worlds even if it means i have to reboot sometimes

plus there's something satisfying about emerge world taking 8 hours while i work on other projects. very soothing background noise :3"

Will Windows always be more popular than Linux?,"I feel like since Windows Recall the Linux community has grown really big, more and more people are making the transition. But vast majority of people say that Linux will never be as popular or even more popular than Windows.

The most common argument is ""accessibility,"" but I don't think thats really the point because (except for some older people) everyone knows how to download an iso file and plug it in a PC. With distributions like Mint or Ubuntu everything is packed in friendly-looking GUIs. Preferably you can easily get Laptops with Pre-installed Linux on it.

Software compatability is very good with tools like Proton and Wine. The number of games that natively support Linux grows and with more popularity Linux would be ""standard operating system"" for companies.

I thought that was what you were supposed to do 

So why do stable distros have out of date apps in the repos? and is it actually a problem?","Here ""stable"" means ""does not unnecessarily change"".

Note that this has nothing to do with whether the software has bugs or not. It just means that if a particular version of the software is supplied by a particular release of a distribution, that version is not significantly changed within the lifetime of that release. It minimises surprises. For instance, you can be confident that the software's user interface is not going to be suddenly different one day. You know that you should not need to update the software's configuration to keep up with changes in the way the software works."

The Steam Deck Sold me on Linux,"Alright, long story short:

Fast forward a decade, I image things are much better. Microsoft lately has been pissing me off with what they've been doing with Windows. And their recent trends are starting to follow what Apple as been doing. So I'm done with them.

I jumped on the band wagon to get the Steam Deck to try it out, worst case scenario I never leave gaming mode, and worse worse case scenario I install windows and live with the consequences.

Probably. It is a computer after all. They all have issues. The bigger question is if you care about the specific ones it has or can tolerate or be bothered to fix them if that is possible. But you will quite likely face _some_ issues.

But if you are not using your computer and don't have anything important on it then what do you have to lose by trying? Some time that it takes to set everything up? You can always install windows again later on. Just make sure to backup everything you might care about on it first.

It can also be helpful to know what programs they need to use and see if these will work on Linux or not.

How to successfully move a team from Windows to Linux?,"I'm in the process of moving a medium-sized team of visual effects artists/supervisors/producers from Windows (7/10) to Linux-based workstations.

I've been using a Linux desktop for many years, and can't remember how is to interact with Linux for the first time. However, I know it can be a bit frustrating and difficult for a lot of people.

I expect to find some resistance, but I truly care about their experience and want them to feel well - hopefully better - in their new environment.

I'd love to hear about individual experiences and also maybe from IT departments that went through a similar process - changing from Windows to Linux.

What was the most difficult thing when doing the transition? What do you like and especially dislike about the new platform?

For example, a lot of these artists are creating images for blockbuster movies/shows and care a lot about the small details. Things like ugly or fragmented interfaces are sometimes OK for analytical/engineering people, but they can ruin an artist's experience.

Anything else that comes to mind that I should pay attention to?","It's best to implement in phases with just one or two Linux machines to start with.

These Linux PCs would serve as practice machines allowing people to get accustomed to the look and feel of the OS AND especially the apps they are working with.                                  People should be allowed to play around with familiar applications such as Internet browser and spreadsheets that are similar in Windows and in Linux.

This arrangement should be done for at least three months.      This will allow people to experiment with non-critical projects.

Linux and Windows are very different in many ways with each having their strengths.      Switching abruptly from one to the other in a **production environment** is inviting trouble.

* tmux, a text mode ""window manager""

* links, a surprisingly full-featured text mode browser (no good for videos, images, or heavy js though)

* midnight commander, a text mode file manager

* htop, a text mode task manager

* nmcli"
Is Linux a good operating system for Iranians?,I live in Iran and I recently wanted to change my operating system from Windows to Linux (probably Ubuntu distribution). I want to know that would there be any problems because of the restrictions in Iran? I probably would have to pirate some applications so...,"As far as I know, Linux would be fine. Linux is very common on servers. Also Linux, its distributions, and many of its available programs are free and open source software, so you likely won't need to pirate as much. What programs do you need an alternative for?"
Alternate open-source web browsers for linux?,"I  am looking for a lightweight web browser that is not a fork of Chrome.  Excluding Firefox, Vivaldi or Brave but can be a fork of Firefox.

I tried GNOME web, qupzilla and midori, but Youtube doesn't behave properly on them.","I must admit I sometimes go through a phase of trying things like Gnome Web and Midori, tempted by the 'lightweight' and 'minimalist' features that they tend to advertise. I always end up going back to Firefox. If you keep the number of tabs under control it's solid as a rock (something I can't say about Midori, as much as I wanted to like it), and the latest versions automatically block nasty social media trackers, which is an added plus.

When and how does one move past the stage of 'copying commands into the terminal'.,"I've had this question tugging at me for a while. I am a brand new Linux user, having switched from Windows 10 to Linux Mint Cinnamon just over a month ago. So far, have got myself familiarized with the terminal, learned a bit about the Linux filesystem, wrote a couple of bash scripts, and even compiled an app from source code(horrifying process).  

The problem is, I don't really feel like I am 'familiar' with Linux. I am still clueless about many things that you can do, and I really couldn't do some of the things without guides on the internet. While I understand the process that goes on inside the guide, I don't understand how you can either remember or just 'know' what you need to do. Should I just keep doing what I am doing, which is learning new things through following various guides and maybe taking the initiative myself, or should I follow a more systematic approach, like getting deep into the theory and learning about Linux from a book.

Can you please tell me what should I do, and whether I am on the right track or not.

Should I Switch to Linux?,"Currently, I have a very nice Windows 10 gaming PC that I thoroughly enjoy.

However, I’m soon to leave for college and unfortunately can’t take it with me. 

Currently, I’m in the market for a lightweight laptop that will only be used for school, digital art, and composing music. Nothing special.

**But this has got me thinking — do I really even like Microsoft‘s OS?**

I’ve always heard about Linux, and only good things. I’ve had friends in the past push me to switch. I used to think there was no need to go through the hassle to switch, but these past few years (especially after all the Cambridge Analytica shit) have had me EXTREMELY paranoid about my privacy, security, and just general digital footprint.

**I don’t want to be tracked, recorded, mined, or monitored in any way, shape or form.**

I’m also primarily concerned with the sneaky way that Microsoft runs some of its programs, services, and apps. It feels at times like I have zero control over my OS — like it’s not really “my computer” but rather a highly commercialized, tightly controlled product like the iPhone. 

That, to me, isn’t a computer. A computer should be customizable, controllable, malleable. Flexible!

I’m about 200% certain that large corporations like Microsoft steal data (even audio, video) from their consumers to better market their products. This probably isn’t news to you guys.

Even more worrying is the vast amount of bullshit that just “comes with” Windows 10. I have a gaming PC, why the hell would I want to see shit about Xbox every day? Why do I need this weird app-store thing when I have a search engine to find my software? Why do you need to shove these things down my throat? Why would I buy a game from Microsoft when I have Steam? 

**In conclusion, I just want control over my OS. All I’ve heard is that Linux is like a sandbox when it comes to PCs. Should I make the switch?**","From the way your post reads, and from person bias: Yes

From my experience trying to explain Linux to a friend: Eh, maybe not.

&#x200B;

Yes, you can customize basically any-and-everything on Linux. That doesn't mean it's gonna be user friendly.

&#x200B;

\>Currently, I’m in the market for a lightweight laptop that will only be used for school, digital art, and composing music. Nothing special.

&#x200B;

Dunno much about music, but audacity exists? For Art, Adobe suite is basically not working. You can get PS CS6 (possibly even the newer ones) to run, but it probably won't support wacom (EDIT: Apparently Wacom does work with Photoshop under wine). Illustrator didn't work last time I tried either. InDesign does work though. No idea about their video stuff. GIMP is great though (except that it doesn't have Smart Objects). Inkscape is....a pain to learn, but technically good for vectors (Adobe Illustrator alternative).

As for generic school stuff, depends. You may or may not be able to use MS office in wine (no idea), but we have our own Office Suites. LibreOffice is big, popular, clunky and has mixed results. WPS is very compatible, modern and somewhat unstable. I haven't tried OnlyOffice or Calligra.

Will your laptop even support Linux? This is much less of an issue then it used to be, but some issues that may arrise are: wifi not working, camera not working, fingerprint not working, suspend ('Sleep') not working.

In the end, it really depends how much you're willing to learn. Are you a 'techie' person normally? Then you may find this fun and intresting. Otherwise it may just be really infuriating.

Lastly, there is the community. Sometimes we're great, other times not so much. You will get a lot of responses as to what you should install and that alone is often a hot topic for debate.

PS: Like another person said, changing OS is only half the battle. Technically apps \_probably\_ wont be tracking you on linux (because most big apps arent available lol, and the whole mentality of free open source apps is a bit different) but stuff like a web browser can still track you. Google is bad. Chome is bad. Get Brave, Vivaldi or firefox if you want. Don't use the Google Search engine (DuckDuckGo is my favorite (and has a lot of extra features like ""bangs""), but Startpage is also an option and uses google-like results). Facebook is awful, so is WhatsApp, Instagram and Twitter. Facebook by design is just terrible, don't use it. WhatsApp is owned by FB so I wouldn't trust them. Get Telegram or something. Some things are trying to gather your data, but can be used anyways. For example, I wouldn't post to instagram but you look at other posts in a private tab/profile. Or if you use android install the app in an sandbox of sorts ([https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.typeblog.shelter&hl=en\_US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.typeblog.shelter&hl=en_US)) . Twitter you can use 3rd party clients (which don't have all the features since they nerfed the API) or the website in private etc. Or just switch to a different social network (like the fediverse). Anyways I could go on for days, it depends how deep you wanna go. But trust me, privacy is a lifestyle. It requires being aware of things and learning how to protect yourself.

&#x200B;

tl;dr

\-Only try linux if you are prepared to learn and research

\-Definitely change your browser, search engine & communication platforms and avoid big companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft etc.

\-Consider learning how to use and installing uMatrix & uBlock Origin in your browser"

"How did you (intermediate - expert level users) ""learn"" linux?","Hey reddit!

I've been using linux from time to time for alot of years, I love it because of the freedom it provides in terms of customization etc, however I do have to google quite alot when i run into problems, even the simpler ones.

Most of the time my googling takes me to a forum where the first post explains everything as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. I wish I had the knowledge to produce such a post, but the way the operating system works is so comprehensive and different from it's non UNIX competitor. And I can never settle with just understanding the shallow ""high level"" stuff. I want to truly understand how my computer works and how to operate it. Everything from commands and scripts to how the bios works.

So reddit, I'd love to hear from you guys how you educated yourself to your level of expertise in this.

EDIT: Thanks for the great and informative replies, keep em coming, they'll probably be of use to others with similar interests. So far I'm really into trying out LFS.","I did

> using linux from time to time

not that.

When I discovered that there was an alternative to Windows, I reformat all of my machines and never looked back.

I learned how to type `man` and `--help`, and I learned how to search for problems, solutions, and situations.

Take a look at Linux From Scratch. You won't really want to *use* it, but it will teach you intimately how everything works."
Did Linux and FOSS made real world impossible for me?,"I don't know if this is a right sub or not but I am exhausted, I need some serious help.

I start using Linux in 2016 and I got very deep into FOSS philosophy.

I refused to use anything non-FOSS. But now it's time for job. I finished my college.

Every  job I see here in India .. seems evil, stupid, freedom disrespecting  and not fun. As a software lover, I don't see any value in it. It's  always some proprietary stupid product with the goal of making money. I  don't even understand how the hell these guys end up making entire  company out of just one stupid app? No body tell them it's time to stop?  and don't even get me started with horrible IT software consultancy  companies. They just see software as a money making machine.

All  my friends took college placements (jobs we get from college) and me  spending all night struggling with bloated websites. Horrible job  portals which first take my resume and then ask the same information  which I mentioned in resume already. They don't save my info they make  sure to ask again and again.

Even if I end up applying. I don't really enjoy the tech in real world. I like FOSS.

If you don't get it. Here is an analogy -

Software + Capitalism = Reality

Software + Socialism = FOSS <3

My  love for software is holding my back so badly. I know I should make a  linked in account, But I don't want to .. People say it's important. You  have to use tools like k8s and things which people now days use. Like  they want me to use VSCode, nodejs or anything non GPL. Now you might  say why not go for low level jobs. Because I don't have any. It's  already difficult to get a job as a freshers.

Also  after knowing how these modern tech invade privacy and how much harm it  provides to nature (do you know power consumption of netflix  streaming?)

Everyone around me  think, even after spending all day/night for years in front of  computers, knowing how to code, Linux and stuff - Why he don't have job ?  People who don't even know these things are getting better jobs. I try a  lot to ignore the fact ""How bad this modern tech is"" But I couldn't.

This is killing me for months **literally**.","I was a lot like you, except a bit more focused on the tech rather than idealism and it was 1998. I've had a lucrative IT career and worked with open source software for the best part of two decades since then. There are few things I'd keep in mind:

 \- FOSS won. Maybe not everyone knows it, but it's true. The Internet runs on free software and these days the bigger the project, the more likely it is to run on FOSS (even if it's being done for the most capitalist reasons).

 \- There will be plenty of work for experts in FOSS, and the more skilled you become at using FOSS to get real world work done, the more options you will have in working for an organisation you care about.

 \- Try to do the right thing\[tm\], but be pragmatic. Sometimes a FOSS solution is the best one, sometimes not, but because of people like you are working at an organisation, at least the FOSS alternative has been considered. To date myself even further with a Sorkin quote: ""Decisions are made by those who show up""."

All I really do is work (through Google Chrome...we are a Google school, so the OS doesn't really matter) and play some games. Right now, I'm playing Albion Online and it has a native Linux client.

My concern is what happens when there's a major update, like BIOS or firmware? Do updates always break things? I've been reading the AO forums and it seems like new updates always break things and it takes time to fix. Is Linux really that easy for people like me, who don't really have the time to learn the OS? Is it meant for everyone to use ""out of the box?""

Kindly Yours Condol1","This isn't a Linux story per se, but close enough.

My friend's dad is a medical physicist. Mainly, he performs radiation screenings for cancer patients. He's a brilliant guy, holds some patents, and recently opened his own clinic.

The clinic got hit by ransomware. All of their Windows machines were affected. Catastrophic IT failure. This left my friend's dad busting his ass over the weekend to get his clinic up and running again. I don't know what he did to get the Windows machines back up---if he paid the hackers or if he reformatted the machines or what---but I do know that he had to set up everything all over again, with substantial data loss. But there was _one_ machine in his office that wasn't affected.

It wasn't a Linux machine. It was a Unix machine. I think it was IRIX. It had an old NeXTSTEP style GUI. It had some proprietary software that hooked up to the medical imaging devices, which it then stored and could export over the network. It had all of his medical images and needed to be reconfigured due to the shitstorm on his intranet.

The setup instructions could be found online and were simple enough if you know your way around a terminal. As I said, this guy is brilliant, but he's not a techie, and he was under a massive amount of stress. His business was in crisis. So when my friend found the instructions for him, he just threw up his hands and declared, ""I can't do that! That's Unix!""

So my friend called me. My reaction was,  ""Of course I can do that! That's Unix!"" I drove across town and ran a few commands, did a little editing in vi (_not_ vim, _vi_) and got him across that hurdle. Clinic saved. (Well, I'm sure he would have gotten it eventually, but I saved him a little time and peace of mind. Which he definitely needed. )

Anyway I've never been prouder to be a Linux guy."

I used Mint for about 2 years and I supported them a lot. I'm using Arch now and I have supported them as well."
How long will Linux's security immunity last?,"As I understand it, Linux's reputation for not needing anti-virus software is more due to most malware being designed for Windows, not because Linux distros are insanely secure. With announcements like South Korea migrating all government computers to Linux, is there an expectation that this privileged status will expire?

EDIT: This got way more response than I was expecting. Thank you all so much!! I hadn't realized how much I was subscribed to an urban myth without any real fact behind it; I learned a lot!!","Yeah, that is not nor has it ever been true. Linux has enjoyed higher levels of security due to not having the legacy requirements of Windows and due to how the user is expected to get software. 

On windows 9X/ME and the preceding DOS with which it retained compatibility, there was no separation of privilege. This obviously meant that no privilege escalation attacks were needed. If you ran malicious software, it could do whatever it wanted and didn't need to exploit anything. Windows NT, while it implemented different user accounts with different permissions, still maintained compatibility with legacy software, often times requiring you to deactivate the increased levels of security to get software to run, which of course everyone did because the OS only exists to support the software running on it. This was greatly improved with Windows Vista that had virtual implementations of the legacy API/ABI, but of course everyone said those security improvements were stupid and turned them off because it was annoying. It wasn't until Windows 7 that there was both increased security (relative to anything XP and before,) but done so in a way that was mostly invisible to users so they didn't turn it off (usually.)

The other difference is in how you get software. With windows 98 and after, it was extremely common and expected that users would go on to the internet, download software, and execute it without much thought. If you're relying on end-user knowledge to determine what software is safe and what isn't, malware execution is inevitable.

On most Linux distros, software was being delivered by the same organization that delivered your distro. Since FOSS software can be packaged up by whomever wants to, Slackware, Debian, Redhat/Fedora, whoever can set up software repositories that sign packages with cryptographic keys controlled by the distro project, so that if you never leave that ecosystem, the chance of executing malicious software is practically nil.

It takes very little knowledge to write malware for Linux, the difficulty is in getting someone to execute it, and because of how the system works, that is a LOT more difficult.

Finding vulnerabilities in discrete software packages is not really any different in windows or Linux, and due to Linux being the OVERWHELMINGLY dominant OS for servers connected to the internet, the ""popularity"" argument never held any water there. I don't know what kind of records exist between RHEL and modern Windows servers that are both set up by knowledgeable people, but RHEL has several layers of security that mitigate most attack vectors. To change something, you'd have to exploit a listening service, then successfully execute a privilege escalation attack (because the service is running as a user with minimal privileges,) then you have to worry about SELinux minimizing what that process can access even with root permissions, then you have to hope that server then has access to something exploitable, because it's likely the network engineer has it sitting behind a firewall that restricts what connections can go in or out. 

Can all of this break down with an incompetent system admin? Yes, but you have to go out of your way to do that on modern enterprise distributions.

Any system is vulnerable, but Windows was for a long time much less secure as a fault of its design and common use. If Linux becomes less secure as it becomes more popular, it will be because individual users are turning off security features that have existed for a long time."

How did you learn all this Linux info?,"I am a complete noob to Linux and I follow some subreddits, and I usually have no idea what is being said.  I have Manjaro and rasbian but other than installing Firefox or Spotify, I know nothing.   My first computer ran windows 95 so I never really had experience with a terminal or not having a GUI.  I’m considering taking community college classes just to learn some coding and comsci things.  I’m assuming y’all learned by doing but me reading wikis and googling “Linux for beginners” doesn’t stick or help understand. 

 I’m genuinely curious how y’all came across this stuff and learned it.","Dive in and learn as I needed to.

That being said...I've not had to really ""learn"" as much as I thought I would.  I'm somewhat of a minority in the linux world in that I'm strictly a *user*, not a *developer*.  I stick to well supported, fully formed distros (usually Ubuntu based).  I use Linux because I genuinely *like* how it does things better than windows, and because of ethical concerns.  But the less tinkering I have to do, the better I like it.  So I'm definitely in the *install it and forget it* camp.

But even though I tend to choose distro's where things don't *usually* go belly up, it does happen to any OS occasionally.  When it does, I learn what i need to learn to fix it and that's about it until the next emergency.

I'd say in the 8 years since I've made the switch full time, I've had to learn maybe 20% of the command line basics and shockingly little about how things work under the hood.

"What's the point of Gentoo being so suckless and lightweight, if you need a powerful PC to compile it faster?","I mean by using Gentoo for personal use, not about why Gentoo is lightweight.

I always wanted to try Gentoo though, but none of my computers are good enough. I have a life and I don't want to wait days. I also don't have a spare computer for installing Gentoo so I have to do it on VM. But I can't let a VM running on my main computer in the background because it sucks too much resources, which makes my main PC slow. Maybe distcc would be the solution if I knew how to use it.","I get that you're hoping someone will give a helpful answer to speed up the compile time in your situation. I wish I had such an answer for you. Yet I detect a couple of misunderstandings in this post.

The first is that Gentoo is in any sense suckless. Since the code you compile under Gentoo is just the Linux kernel and external libraries and apps, there is no limit on the lines of code nor any concern for whether a suckless person would define them as ""bloated"" (or not). Gentoo exists so that one is able to take advantage of the microarchitecture features of their CPU family in their Linux distro. This can certainly lead to long build times, even on powerful build machines or build farms.

The second misunderstanding (from your replies to comments) isn't _really_ a misunderstanding. You seem aware of the fact that there are certain limitations to running resource-intensive processes. Yet all of your replies so far give me the impression you're hoping you could somehow pour 3 liters of water into a 2 liter bottle. As if there's some magic secret to quickly building an entire OS distro from source files on a dual-core 3GHz processor with 8GB of RAM -- while still using the system for other tasks. My decades of computer usage going back to the Commodore-64 tells me there isn't such a secret. But I'll definitely watch this comment thread to see if someone proves me wrong!"
"How come when Apple releases an entire new architecture most applications are ported over in a year, but when Linux is here since the '90s app devs go out of their way to make sure it won't run?",Apple m1 is likely around 2% market share just like Linux... so why,"""hardware platform"" vs ""operating system"".

Apple's M1 still runs macOS and still has the same APIs. While there is of course more to it, porting still kind of boils down to having a compiler that throws out ARM machinecode instead of x86_64 machinecode. As long as the source-code isn't CPU dependent (no direct assembly or relying on CPU specific features) it's often just a matter of recompiling the source-code.

Porting to another OS is a completely different matter. You don't usually have the same APIs and even if you have you run quickly in quirks where even though functions are the same the stil behave slightly different. There is no WIN32 API on linux (lets leave wine aside for the moment), no quartz toolkit for linux....to port over source-code you need to do major rewrites. 

Or to illustrate it differently...debian is able to support [10 different hardware platforms](https://wiki.debian.org/SupportedArchitectures) with several more being in unsupported or un-offical state. That's far more than apple supports (Four at the moment I think: arm, i386, x86_64 and ppc *(edit: wrong, check /u/gehzumteufel 's reply below)*). And while I for sure don't want to play down the hard work that goes in each of those ports it's still far less work that trying to get another operating platform working (Also seen in that page with none of the other kernels having even supported status)"

Best distro for a CS nerd switching to Linux full time?,"I’m currently at my wit’s end with a problem on Windows that has plagued me through three reinstalls, but booting up a live usb makes my computer run like a dream. What would be my best option for making sure everything works consistently, even if it requires some techy legwork? My biggest concerns are reliability, and good multimonitor support along with good gaming performance.

"New to Linux, heard a lots of praises, but not satisfied with the experience.....what is wrong and how to solve it?","I switched to Linux about 4 months ago, dual booting it alongside Windows 10. Since then I have not used Windows 10 and have been daily driving Pop OS.

Everything is fine (except some things I will be mentioning below) and I love the experience a lot, I need to reboot a lot less and I don't need to wait for my computer to update for half an hour before closing and it also boots up relatively faster. I really love the customization it lets you do and that has been the main selling point for me. I don't receive any annoying ad notifications and has become very productive with the tiling window manager. I love the experience so much that I never want to go back to Windows.

But I also face some problems sometimes which I never faced on Windows 10 and I wonder why they are happening when one of the main claims of the people how encouraged me to switch to Linux was that Linux is relatively more stable than Windows. The problems I am facing include that all of a sudden sometimes double tap on track pad for left click doesn't work and I have to connect a physical mouse to logout and log back in to get it working again. Another problem was the left click menu was persistent and was not going no matter what I do unless I open another left click menu somewhere else. Once I also had my login screen not recognizing my password and not letting me in even after so many attempts, then it finally let me in after the first attempt when I rebooted it.

All these problems are related to the DE as far as I know. I wonder if Gnome is at fault. In any case it's ruining my experience with Linux and making me consider going back to Windows (more because I am not able to trouble shoot it and I even don't have time to do it.....and I can't keep on working on a laptop which as DE problems right when I am doing a very important work).

What should I do? should I switch to another distro with a different DE (although I really like the look and feel of Cosmic) or is there a fix to this (This is driving me so crazy that I am considering to do what I haven't done in the past 4 months: go back to Windows)?

Edit: Thanks everyone for your generous offer of help, the problem is solved now. Apparently Pop OS switch to wayland the last time I updated and messed up my touch pad for some reason.....

- The exact same liveUSB was used to install Fedora in an Asus Machine with no problems. 
- I have another identical computer (same hardware). It shows the same problem with several distros.

NVidia still a mess, requires proprietary drivers.

AMD is plug'n'play with AMDGPU driver. Still misses Freesync, but it's on its way.

I used Ubuntu and changed to Arch. Ubuntu is the officially supported distro for most of things, but it's ""stable"", as in ""we do not update things very often"". So I am happier with a rolling distro.

Anyway, it's possible to force update kernel and drivers in Ubuntu, and it's actually what Wendell shows in LinusTechTips [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsgI1mkx6iw).

Is it possible to use Linux without constant tinkering?,"I’ve been really wanting to make the switch from Windows to Linux. After spending time reading posts here and elsewhere, I’m convinced there are real benefits e.g. stability, privacy, control, and a strong community. I’m sold on the *IDEA* of Linux. But in practice, I keep hitting walls (even if they are small walls).

I’ve tried a number of distros recently such as Linux Mint, Zorin OS, Pop!\_OS, Nobara, Ultramarine, and most recently openSUSE (really loved this one). But every time, there’s always something that doesn’t work out of the box: a printer, an external monitor, Bluetooth, weird suspend issues, etc. The kinds of things that should “just work.”

I don’t mind using the terminal when I need to because I was a sysadmin for years (but haven't used Linux in like 15 years and memory hasn't been on my side) but I simply don’t have the time to spend hours troubleshooting basic stuff anymore. And that’s what makes it hard to commit. Each time I run into one of these snags, I end up back on Windows, feeling frustrated and disappointed.

How do you manage the trade-off between control and convenience?

Is it realistic to expect a “just works” experience on Linux if I don’t want to tinker much?

I’m not trying to start a distro war or complain for the sake of it. I want to make this work. Just hoping to hear from people who’ve either overcome these same frustrations. Am I just not patient enough?

Thanks in advance!

The bigger thing may be that you have to make sure you peripherals play nice. Example: I stopped using an elgato capture card and moved to a Linux friendly one. 


Ubuntu usually has the best ""just works"" effect AFAIK because they're willing to bundle software with dirty license/EULAs and pay for vendor attention. I'd put Fedora right after that. All these other smaller distro will give you mixed results (openSuse being the outlier in your list). Try those and get a stable starting point - Then maybe dual boot a smaller one.

How to get started with audio on linux conceptually/programmatically,"Hello fellow tuxers,

I'd love to read a book that ties those things together, instead of reading the respective manpages/documentation. I feel like it is a better way for me to get acquainted.

I want to read this stuff so that I can get most out of linux when producing music, but also to get simple stuff like mpd working without too much of a hustle.

Pointers/tips very welcome.

Excuse my writing, writing from a shitty client on my phone :s

- https://lievenmoors.github.io/ (linux and linux audio guide)
- https://jan.newmarch.name/LinuxSound/ (Programming and using Linux sound)

Both are obviously not books but look like rather in-depth introductions. Haven't read them, they look good though. Both cover ALSA, Jack and Pulseaudio which I consider important. Again, any more tips are welcome!

EDIT2: Thanks for all your suggestions. What all you are saying boils down to is that there seems to be no ONE book I could/should read to get me started (unlike ONE good book to get me started with the command-line, or ONE good book to get me started with a particular programming language). That's quite a shame regarding the complexity of linux audio, but oh well... :D

Actually, I am NOT trying to learn about sound synthesis and music production per sé. Also, I am NOT looking for a pre-configured distro to take the hustle away from me.

I've had frustrating experiences setting up mpd/pulseaudio/jack/alsa the way I want it to work, while hearing that those are great utilities with a lot of capabilities. In other words, I want to get acquainted with the stuff so I can profit from these capabilities to the max.

Then on linux you have package managers and at least the official repositories are checked. It's not that a virus *can't* be in there, but it's much less likely. On windows the usual way is to install a program by downloading an installer off the internet with zero control so it's easier to distribute malware that way.

"Why do Linux drivers need to be recompiled on kernel updates, when Windows drivers don't ?","Hi all,

Not sure if that's the right place to post this... This is something about a difference between Windows and Linux I've been wondering for a long time and could never find an answer to.

On any Linux distribution, when the kernel is updated, all of the in-tree drivers are recompiled and shipped with it. This also means that if you have any out-of-tree drivers on your system, you need to recompile them as well, hence the birth of DKMS. I totally understand that, since drivers are kernel modules and use the kernel API : it makes sense that they would need to be recompiled along with the whole kernel.

But on all my Windows systems, there's a lot of cases when I needed to use third-party drivers, including but not limited to, graphics cards. I've also had to install other drivers as well for all kinds of different hardware. But in all these years of using Windows (98, XP, 7, 10), with all the updates I've done, there are bound to have been kernel updates. But I never recall needing to go to any manufacturer's website to find an updated version of their drivers due to a Windows update. But Windows drivers also use the kernel API, namely WDM and WDF. So why is recompilation not necessary for them when the kernel is updated ?

Thanks !  


EDIT / Thanks to people in the comments, the answer is : because Windows maintains a stable ABI while Linux does not. [And there are reasons](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/stable-api-nonsense.rst).","The Linux kernel doesn't have a stable API/ABI for drivers, Windows does.

"Does Linux have any sort of ""compress files to save disk usage"" like in Windows?","I was just looking at my disk usage on my PC and I remembered that Windows has an option to compress all of the files on your disk so that you can save disk usage, at the expense of load times and CPU usage (which doesnt matter to me since I have an SSD and high-end CPU). I tried looking online to see if the option is available on Linux somehow, but I couldn't find anything. So I thought I would ask here. Is there any equivalent option for Linux?",strictly speaking that's a filesystem feature not a OS feature. filesystems supporting transparent compression are btrfs/f2fs/zfs(/reiser4).
Heading back to Linux after 14 years of Mac.,"I'm looking for a recommendation of a distro to install on a brand new machine with a blank SSD. 

Previously I used mandrake.

I'll mainly be doing video/photo editing and maybe some occasional game play. 

After using Mac for 14 years, I've decided to build a computer. 

If it matters, I'm using an asus z490 Motherboard with an i9 10900K CPU and 32gb DDR4 3600.

Edit: thank you everyone for giving me good options and a place to start. 
I'm going to try LMDE 4 Cinnamon and Manjaro. 
Plenty of reading to do.","If your primary use case is Adobe products and gaming, you're going to be better off installing Windows 10 and running Linux in a VM or at least use dual boot. 

While you technically can use PCI passthrough in a VM with Qemu (vmWare Workstation/Player is not supported), it's a pain in the ass.  For one, you will need two GPU's and you can not use the same GPU for Linux and your VM at the same time.  That means, if you want to use your fancy 5700 in a Windows VM for Adobe and then use it in a game on Linux, you will have to reconfigure Linux and reboot every time.  This also means you will need to move around video cables from your primary GPU to your second GPU or use two inputs on your monitor.

For gaming it depends on what type of games you like to play.  Steam with Proton has greatly improved over the years but it's not perfect.  There are also some other ways to run games through Wine but YMMV.  If you like on-line games with anti-cheat or new release AAA games, they likely will not work in Linux until quite some time after release."
Use Timeshift for backups and restore,"Seriously, if you use Mint or a fork of Ubuntu, or really any distro that supports it - I urge you to learn how to use Timeshift and put it to good to use. It will save you a lot of time and frustration from troubleshooting when you inevitebly break something and you need to get back to work asap. It's fast and easy to use too.

All you have to do is boot from live distro, launch time shift, restore the image to the appropriate drive and you're back to work in less than 5 minutes.

EDIT: This turned into a very good resource for anyone trying to learn how to do linux backups. Thanks for sharing your thoughts people.","Absolutely second this.
I tinker a lot with my system (Manjaro) and time and again Timeshift safed my sanity.

Once there was even a regular, buggy, update that fully borked my system. And again, Timeshift for the rescue."
"What would you say is ""familiarity with Linux""?","I applied for a job and one of the requirements was ""Familiarity with UNIX/Linux"". My experience with Linux is only through using it for a cryptography class, where I learned some the basics, e.g. cd, chmod, cat, nano and some other things I might be forgetting.

I know how the CLI and syntax of it works, I just dont know any specific commands. For a personal project, I connect into a Linux VM on Google Cloud Platform in order to run a cronjob for a python script, but its nothing impressive.

Apart from that I didnt adopt it as my main OS or really use it. I dont even have experience with UNIX, but I dont think my school wanted to pay for that, and I didnt either. But Im pretty sure its similar to Linux, as Linux is built off of Unix.

But now I have an interview tomorrow and I am wondering how out of my depth am I here? If someone required ""Familiarity with Linux"", what would you say is the baseline? Like what should one be able to do in order to say they are familiar with Linux?","Your experience is probably fine. If I were writing a job description, and I had ""familiarity with linux"" as the requirement, your experience would be more than adequate. If I wanted any level of proficiency or expertise, I'd say so in the description.

I'd use this requirement on a description for someone who doesn't need to do any diagnostic or problem solving within Linux. The role would probably entail some mundane routine tasks that require command line access, but are documented and that you can pretty much just copy/paste.  
So basically I'd expect you to know how to ssh into a host, how to run commands, navigate the filesystem (`cd`, `ls`, etc), maybe transfer a file, etc. Pretty low bar."
"Can we get a sticky post called ""What distro do you recommend for noobs/low-ish end hardware?""","Every time i see a post from this subreddit it's one of those two questions and the answer is normally the same: Linux Mint is fine. If you want something lighter go with Debian/Mint XFCE.

I love seeing all the new attention that Linux is getting and I think a sticky post would help.

"What's the difference between 'cat < file', 'cat << file' and 'cat file' ?","## Things I DO understand:

1. In `cat < file`, the stdin is redirected to a file.
2. In `cat file`, `file` is an argument and stdin isn't redirected.

## Things I DON'T understand:

1. I have no idea what the `<<` which seems to be a standard input redirection operator means. Where you want to use it? I just saw it on stackoverflow in this line: `cat <<EOT >> greetings.txt line 1 line 2 EOT`

**tldr**: What's the use case for each of these commands and things I should know or probably be careful about them.","""<<"" is for [here-documents](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html)

Right after the << you put a string that ends the input. in your example that string is EOT. Then everything afterwards until that limiting string (EOT) is redirected to standard input. You use this if you want to feed standard input not with a file or the output of another program but instead with something you type in the shell.

Edit: unsure about the `cat <<EOT >> greetings.txt line 1 line 2 EOT` example you gave...in that exact form it doesn't work. It probably has to look like this:

    $ cat <<EOT >> greetings.txt
    > line 1
    > line 2
    > EOT

That will redirect the output on the cat command to file file greetings.txt (if file exists append to the file because of double >>) and feed the standard input of cat with the here-document
    
    line 1
    line 2

...thus creating a file greetings.txt with those two lines."

Actually check if anything supports your phone, because phones are stupid pieces of garbage and require personalized builds of Android or whatever else for each one.

Why Ubuntu is not recommended in 2022?,"Since I'm in Linux community, I see opinion that Ubuntu is not the best choice for non-pro users today. So why people don't like it (maybe hardware compatibility/stability/need for setting up/etc) and which distros are better in these aspects?","For several years now, Ubuntu/Canonical has been making decisions in what many consider to be an arbitrary & dictatorial manner that is seen as contradictory to the philosophy and ideals of  FOSS and Linux.

Many ""old timers"" felt that Canonical ran over users roughshod when they shifted from Gnome2 to Gnome3. This was the beginning of the split and resulted in several new distros and DE's, such as Mate, etc.

Recently, Ubuntu/Canonical have embraced ""Snaps"", which some feel are inconsistent with many FOSS & Linux values. Some criticisms include:

* snaps come bundled with dependencies, so they're larger than their counterparts from other package managers.
* snaps are slower to run than traditional packages.
* snap distribution requires devs to set up an account with Canonical and host their snaps on it. 
* snap packages don't go through stringent checks and reviews by the community.
* Snap's back-end is closed-source and controlled by Canonical.

So, this is seen as yet another instance of Ubuntu/Canonical ramming things down the Linux community's throat. Many people see Canonical as acting like Microsoft and they've simply had enough of it."
will linux always be in C ?,what is the future ?,"Most likely there will always be some C. Eventually some other language with better guarantees will be accepted and with time old C code will be deprecated or updated to the new language.

How would I figure out what a Linux server is actually doing?,"Hi there,

Very simple question I was asked in an interview: ""Walk me through how you would figure out what a Linux server is doing. How would you determine its purpose?""

I answered something to the effect of ""I would use ps or top to determine what processes its currently running"" 

Its been bugging me not knowing if I was on the right track and I cant seem to find a direct answer, so I thought I'd ask here.

Thank you for your help!","Those open-ended interview questions don't have any specific ""right"" answer. Purpose is to get a quick glimpse into how good you are in the area of that particular question, in this case Linux administration. Something similar to the famous ""What happens when you press a key on a keyboard?"".

So your answer could be literally anything along the lines of: - you know how to check/observe tasks/users/system services, where to get to a service or system logs, find opened files, network connections, opened/blocked firewall ports, authentication setup, connected devices (is there something interesting or special on PCI bus, on USB?), mounted volumes, .. and so on and on, deeper and deeper inside bottomless rabbit hole.

So I'd say you should not lose any sleep on whether you got it ""right"". ps/top are fine answers.

Little bit of a joke - valid answer might as well be ""let's switch it off and see who complains"". ;-)"

Will other Distros be getting Secure Boot Support ?,"Secure Boot is probably not that much of an important feature as advertised but since Windows 11 REQUIRES it to be enabled, people trying to Dual boot just have to stick with Ubuntu cause other Distros don't support Secure Boot out of the Box :(

And We can only stick with Windows 10 until 2025 so what will dual booting be like after that ?

Either Windows 11 needs to be a bit cool over the Secure boot rule or Linux distros could start supporting it ?","The secure boot shim only verified a thin loader that then loads the real boot loader. It should be fine or use regardless of distro. 

There are some other ways to do it, like adding your own keys to the EFI and self-signing (if your system supports it, around 20% of the ones I’ve checked allowed for this)

Advice for career move towards Linux?,"Just looking for some advice from Linux pros who've been out there a while, thanks for taking a minute.

I'm 56, been in IT for 25 years, almost all Windows, some Cisco. Been working with Linux for a few years in my (extensive) home lab, but never in a production environment. Currently studying for LPIC-1, then planning on LPIC-2.

I was recently laid off (before CV19) so looking for a new sys/net admin position. I'm seeing a lot of Linux positions and I've been wanting to move that direction, but with my lack of production Linux experience plus my age I'm not sure what to expect.

Any thoughts at all greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!","Oh, man, the ageing factor. I am 43 and I also had to reinvent myself. Luckily I was quick enough to embrace the academic life, so here is one first option: turning yourself into an IT teacher. It surprises me how my students value my knowledge about things I learned from years in the industry.

If academia is not your thing, I really recommend you to pay some attention to DevOps. It is not constrained to linux, but a large portion of it happens in linux environments. As DevOps cannot exist without the ""Ops"", I think there's still room for you. So, transitioning from sysAdm to sysOps is another possibility.

I know Artix Linux exists, but I don't know a whole lot about package availability on other distros, if it would be the same kind of process to build packages for a distro that uses a different init system, or if its kind of a universal build process for all linux distros on x86","Running Gentoo with OpenRC here (though you can choose between either OpenRC or SystemD when installing).

Honestly, not a whole lot is different other than how you manage services. You also have more independent tools for managing tasks that SystemD would normally handle, for example for logging I use sysklogd instead of journalctl which is what you use with SystemD, theres a few other logging daemons to choose out there so you can take your pick.

I mostly use OpenRC because I dislike how dependent the rest of the distros have become on SystemD, GNOME needs SystemD for a lot of it's features, for example. SystemD it's self is ok IMO (there are things I dislike about it, but there are things I like as well), I just dislike how dependent we have become on it.

I think people also make too much of an issue about how complicated it is to write scripts for OpenRC, Runit, etc. For simple ones it's pretty simple IMO. For example here is my OpenRC script for lm\_sensors:

How difficult is gaming on linux in 2024,"Im a long using Windows 11 user, but i like to use the most of performance of my pc so im playing with the idea of switching to linux. 

My explicit question is, im a gamer and how difficult is it playing games(installing etc.) like GTA V or Minecraft on linux?

Best regard from germany and Grüße!

Full Linux enterprise over Microsoft?,"Anyone running a complete enterprise Linux environment comparable to a full Microsoft environment? Domain controllers, email, file shares, active directory? Looking to see if anyone has a full environment on a Linux stack.","I do projects for CERN, it's almost entirely Linux what they are running."
Programs that are holding me back from completely switching to Linux (Manjaro),"Hey everyone!

I recently got into Linux (specifically Manjaro), and with the disappointment that Windows 11 is looking to be, I jumped ship to Linux. I also just want to get away from Microsoft's spying. However, there are a couple things that are holding me back.

&#x200B;

1. Snip & Sketch: The shortcut for it (Windows + Shift + S) is just too useful for me. It instantly brings up a crosshair to ""snip"" and instantly copies it to the system clipboard. It also displays a notification right after the snip which, when clicked, opens the image in a basic editor for annotations. This has been tremendously useful for me.
2. Clipboard history: is there a clipboard history tool for Linux? I love using Windows 10's clipboard because sometimes I need to copy multiple things and paste them elsewhere. Simple hitting \`Windows + V\` allows the last 25 items to be retrieved.
3. Logitech Options: I have an MX Master 2S that I use daily and I have a few shortcuts programmed onto it via Logitech Options. These have become a second nature to me, and I was hoping to find an equivalent program for Linux
4. MSI Afterburner: I have a GTX 980, and Afterburner is the best GPU control software that I have used. It's got everything in it from fan control to overclocking to a built-in OSD. Although, I only really use the OSD and fan control.

Other than some minor gripes, this is all I have to say about Linux. It's great overall (it made my computer feel a lot more responsive) but these few things are keeping me tied to Windows :/

Any help is appreciated! Thank you!

Edit: made point #3 less ambiguous, I didn't write that one too well, my bad; also made point 4 more clear","Hi, to start with i recommend that you use something with kde as some of these programs are in kde, to start with the snip & sketch shortcuts and functions are pretty much the same as the ones in spectacle (KDE's screenshot tool) and there are even more but you'll have to change some shortcuts and change the default setting that saves the screenshot instead of copying it, the clipboard history comes in a little system tray icon in the KDE desktop by default and for the last thing, MSI afterburner there's greenwithenvy from wich I've heard a lot of amazing things, as for the Logitech software I'm sure there are good alternatives out there but I don't really know any to be honest

Ahhhh!! I lost 531GB of my hard drive data! Any hope???,"Sooo uh you see I’m a 16 years old linux noob and I was installing kubuntu. I ordered a new 1tb drive to put kubuntu on while my 500gb nvme had windows. I also had this other 1tb hard drive but I used it to store all of my files like programs and 3d models from the past year. 

So this is how it went down…
I booted up from the usb flash drive and loaded in. I went through the first few stpws of the installation pretty easily. And then…selecting the disk came. I stood there for a good 30 minutes making sure I chose the right option and disk. Googling and all that.

When I was selecting the disk I noticed that one didn’t have a bar at all and underneath it it had “1 tb Kubuntu” with the Guided - Entire disk option. My thought process was “Oh the drive isn’t showing uo meaning that windows probably is keeping it away from linux”. So then I left that drove alone(which turns out it was the brand new drive) and I went to the other drive and it did show NTFS and that nice looking bar. I was then like oh ok this is were the new is and needs to be installed. I akso had this option to like resize a partition for dual boot or whatever, but I did Google what that was and I cannot remember finding anything AT ALL. I saw this installation video like a couple months old I believe and was like oh this must a a brand new feature then. 

I then went ahead with the thought that I selected the new drive and not the other one. I chose the Guided - Entire Disk and went ahead. Boom. Kubuntu looked beautiful when I booted into it like 😳. Ok so after having a good moment, I took a look at my drive and noticed that my ‘E:’ drive was no longer showing up. The E: drive wasthe 531GB drive. I start to worry and head to Windows. I booted to windows and saw my E: drive no longer there. I had chosen the wrong drive.

Out of panick I quickly had a litle breakdown, but then I wanted to act asap on recovering data. I ran DMDE and I recovered only 1 blender file after 2 hours of it scanning. I do not understand how DMDE even worked so I got all confused. I saw TestDisk being popular and before even trying any other methods I’m just wondering.

Am I even gonna recover MOST of my data? I went to sleep that night thinking it was all a dream. I could not sleep thinking about it for 30 minutes.

✨Thank you to anyone who helps out✨

Does android x86 count as a linux distro?,Yeah it's a bit idiotic but I'm just curious.,"That depends on how you want to define the term ""Linux distro"". If you define it as ""an operating system that is based on the Linux kernel"", then Android is a Linux distro."
"Since systemd is so criticized, why did nobody fork it?","This might be a dumb question. Consider all the criticism gravitating around systemd:

* The fact that it should be only an init system, while in reality it does more than that. This violates a principle that is a part of Unix philosophy. Software should do one thing really well, but systemd does more than one thing.
* Too much code running in PID1
* Too many required modules, too many dependencies
* Too many features required in modules
* The lead developer wants things ""his way""
* and many others...

My question is: why did nobody fork it and modify it to solve part of these issues?

I assume that there could be other people interested in forking such project and make just an init system out of it, or something that is more compliant with the unix philosophy. On the other hand, I guess it is still a big project to fork, so it will take countless hours to modify it...",The things that it was criticized for wouldn't be served by forking it.

How to stay up to date with kernel programming?,"Hello

When learning to write for instance kernel modules or do other kernel programming quite some things change sometimes. Some functions become deprecated or approaches change etc... Eg [this famous book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/linux-device-drivers/0596005903/) is not up to date any more either.

I tend to lookup explanation about functions [on this official website](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/)

But still then, this website for instance does not explain which steps one has to go through (eg when writing a device driver you have to create a class before being able to create a device). It gives a very brief explanation about the functions without any details. Which is why every time I have to do kernel programming I mostly end up copying others people code because there is no real **good** documentation AFAIK.



Si my questions are:


- where can I find official or good documentation explaining how to eg write kernel space modules (or do other kernel programming)? Eg something as good as this: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/File-Function.html

- Where can I find out whether a function is deprecated and its new alternative? So I stay up to date


Thanks","The official documentation and the source code. 
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

and git grep are your best friends, honestly these are the best sources 

There's also https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source if you'd prefer

I started out with LDD3/Linux kernel development (Robert Love) and quickly found the official docs and source code were a way better source of information.  Also you can use git grep to search for examples of things you're trying to implement in already existing code.  Someone else mentioned LKML which is also great but it's A LOT of messages, many of which are irrelevant.  It's nice to read Linus' emails when a new mainline kernel comes out though.  I'd suggest just using one of the HTML LKML trackers (lore.kernel.org) and just searching for stuff as you need it.  I've found a lot of LKML emails come up when I google certain things and they're always helpful"

The parent should not explicitly wait on the child to finish by calling the blocking `wait` systemcall. Polling the child is not an option neither.

Why do Linux apps commonly have the letter d appended to the end of their name?,Like snapd or systemd,"The D stands for daemon. a daemon  is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user.

rc.local - that's the legacy System V init configuration script which is mostly unused or missing in modern distros. It used to be running when a specific runlevel was reached, usually runlevel 3 (nowadays multiuser.target with systemd).

.bashrc - the bash local configuration file which will mostly set up environment variables, local user scripts and aliases, if not used in other files like .bash\_profile, .profile (for all shells), or .bash\_aliases (for aliases, obviously). Still in use where bash didn't get obsoleted by another shell, like zsh or never got used, like in small systems with busybox.

init.d - that's the legacy System V init configuration folder which is gone in many distros nowadays.

systemd - the most prevalent init system nowadays, next to Upstart, OpenRC or SysVinit, among others. Most controversial init system, but it can do a lot of things.

and crontab - you put things in there to run at specific intervals, started by a cron daemon, like cronie, anacron, fcron, vixie-cron."

 - updates can be managed with a central local repository that all Linux machines pull updates from. I'm not sure if there is a specific application similar to WSUS for Linux, so may be a CLI job each time.
  
- monitoring, depending on needs to be monitored. Nagios/CheckMK or similar for resources, on machines. Maybe Squid acting as a Web Proxy, for logging and filtering. 
  
- something like Ansible/Jenkins could be used for an automated processes, pushing our applications, upgrades etc.

The cryptocurrency community say that keeping passwords on your internet facing machine is terrible in terms of security but it is the norm in linux space to use password managers on the same machine so who is right?,"I thought there was no problem if you are keeping them on encrypted password managers but the crypto folks say it is a big no no and you must never have passwords touch your internet facing machine and use cold storage and such like and only write them down or scribe passwords/seeds onto metal tablets. I see what they are saying about keyloggers and such 'attack vectors' but I also never see this discussed in the every day linux space and I know linux users take security very seriously as well so I wondered why the discrepancy?

Is it just because most linux user's passwords are not so important so they don't require as much security as safely storing digital currency so the threat level is such that it is ok to keep passwords on the same computer?

EDIT: Some good replies so far. It is helping to get a better understanding of each side of the equation and seems replies are in line to what I had initially thought; good to go into more depth on each of the caveats.","There's literally no reason why you can't have it be stored on an internet-facing device.

p.s. I don't actually advise anyone to gpg encrypt and store their crypto info online, because there's no need to introduce unnecessary risk factors. But for the curious, I do personally store passwords online in this way as a backup."
Creating a home cluster from old CPUs? Where to begin?,"Hello all, I’m currently doing a PhD that involves a heavy amount of scientific computing.

It becomes so hard to justify even a $200 RAM upgrade on my personal PC, if I know that I can  always run my code in seconds on one of these powerful machines. Pricing goes down to the minute by the way, so if my problem just takes 5 minutes to upload and run on their 96 CPU machine, that's just 42¢ that it cost to run.

I could spend $10k to build an awesome system at my house, and still the problem takes 45 minutes to run. In the case of my work, that could have been 45 wasted minutes, only to find that the simulation was set up incorrectly. Or, I pay 42¢ a pop, and get my answer in seconds or minutes.

I've always just had three partitions: root filesystem, swap, and boot, and I never really questioned why.  So why is this partitioning scheme recommended, and why do many distros (e.g. Mint, Manjaro) just format to 2-3 partitions by default?","Separating /home lets you reinstall/change distro keeping most of your files and settings.

Separating /tmp protects you against some user filling that folder, it will empty the free space on that partition, but won't fill your ""/"" partition rendering the system unusable.

Separating /var might do something similar, but instead of protecting against some user, most programs use the /var directory for high-volume storage, so if you are not careful and you let some program collect data until the partition is full, you'll experience some problems but probably the system will keep alive.

Separating /etc also lets you reinstall keeping most system settings."

Long story made short - for the longest time, I've been working for the sake of chasing the big bucks. I was making a ton of money in the Alberta Oilsands but was never happy. I was never passionate about the work I did and decided to leave and jump into IT. I figured that, as long as your passionate in what you do, you'll eventually start making good money anyway- although, money is no longer my main priority anymore but quality of life. I got into IT because I've always been a techy and was going to school for it before life started to go another direction for me...

I was faced with a very broad choice of paths and I tried everything from networking to coding and some windows sys admin work but was still not satisfied. I was certain that I was passionate in IT but that's a pretty broad statement still. 

It wasn't until I opened and AWS account and tried connecting to a RHEL server that I became hooked. I honestly feel very passionate about Linux- I spend all my free time learning about RHEL and it's gotten to the point where I've actually dreamt of doing things in BASH and using vim. If this isn't what it means to find your passion, then I don't know what is. I'm hoping to network more now and get direction and insight in my new career path.

How does hard drive encryption work?,"From my naive point of view, encryption means applying some algorithm to a string of text. For example I might replace each letter with the next letter from the alphabet. Of course, secure encryption algorithms are much more complex than this.

So I would think that in order to encrypt my harddrive, the computer would need to go through 1000GB of data, bit for bit and apply this complex mathematical algorithm. But this would propably take a lot of time, thinking of the time to read 1000GB from the hard drive and writing some new 1000GB to it, alone. What's more, even if I hard kill my computer by pressing the power button, the next time I start it, the hard drive is encrypted again. So something else must be going on.

So I did that, and everything worked. 

Ok, verblox, I told myself, I'm sure this answer was in the man page. You need to learn to be independent and think for yourself. Why don't you do what you should have done at the beginning of this and scan the man page for the answer? So I did. Here's what I found:

How is Linux free software but Unix proprietary?,"My understanding is that Unix is proprietary software and that Linux is free software based on it. My question is how that can be. Wouldn’t any copyright on Unix apply to Linux, which, by my understanding, is very similar?","Linux is not directly based on Unix, it is a Unix clone. It looks like it, it behaves like it, but it is not related to Unix at all.

The BSD family of OSs are direct descendants of Unix, they are permissively licensed. AT&T the (back then) owners of Unix re licensed some bloodlines of Unix back in the late 1980's to the permissive BSD license."
Why is holy C so under utilized?,I have recently looked into holy c (language for templeOS) and it is really a well written language particularly for its time period (16bit era) with improved switch statements and running code at compile time. Why does no one seem to be interested in it. No software project or anyone else seems to be remotely interested in it either in improving it or using it in some software. What do you guys think why that is?,"This right here. We were actually in the 64bit era when Davis started. He chose 16-bit because he thought he was commanded to do so by God...

I found a problem on a wifi driver and also found the solution from 5 years ago. Why isn't the solution already part of kernel? How can I report it so that it gets implemented?,"I have been using Linux mint 18 for several yerars, but now reached EOL. So I decided to upgrade

I loaded the live version of latest Linux Mint (21, which is LTS, I was so happy!) and everything looked ok, but for some reason my wifi SSID didn't show up in network manager list (other ssid were listed, the wifi card is working). After a long search  I understood that my router works on channel 13 (and I can't change that..., \[EDIT\] but guys, I live in Italy, (why so many people assume I'm in the USA?) And the same wifi card used to work in older versionsof kernel , and, morevoer, all the devices I have work flawlessy , smartphones, laptops, tablets...) and for some reason I really didn't understand, the latest driver of my Qualcomm Aetheros card has the channel 13 disabled.

I found a ""[solution](https://askubuntu.com/questions/894283/qualcomm-atheros-device-cant-find-channel-13-wifi-ubuntu-16-04-2)"" that maybe works, but involves a recompilation of the wifi module every time I upgrade the kernel. This solution is from 5 years ago, and involves changing one or two lines of the source code of the atheros driver, recompiling it and replacing the mainline one with this (I may be wrong, I am by no means an expert).

I wonder, why something that was working well it is not working anymore? Why an issue with a solution from several years ago is not yet part of mainline kernel?

How can this be reported so tat hopefully the solution become part of mainline?

\[EDIT 2\]

changing region is not enough, a recompilation of the kernel is necessary because of a bug in the region stuff,

Linux Mint forum thread with a guy with same issue and solution implemented: [here](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=236357)","tl;dr The kernel devs are unwilling to work around a problem in your hardware.

Your card, even though it may be sold & bought in Italy, defaults in its EEPROM to 0x69 = WOR9_WORLD (a restrictive set). The kernel policy on this is userspace actions can only further restrict, not expand, the available channels set by the hardware; otherwise it would be too easy to enable channels you are not allowed to.

Complain to Atheros / whoever sold you the card; or buy different hardware that is correctly set to Italy.

The fact that in older kernels you could change reg domain in userspace does not make this a bug, unfortunately. It was just too permissive back then."
Why does installing GNU/Linux on an older desktop/laptop make it work faster than with Windows?,Why does installing GNU/Linux on an older desktop/laptop make it work faster than with Windows?,"Windows runs a lot of unnecessary processes.  Each version of Windows is mostly a layer of stuff on top of the previous version of Windows.  Old junk is rarely removed.

That is why there are multiple locations for startup programs.  For each new version of Windows, someone decides the old startup locations aren't good enough and adds a new one.  This makes it easier for malware to become entrenched into the system and harder for users to stop unwanted processes from running.

Windows also does a lot of bookkeeping.  Since it doesn't have a proper package repository, it has to track each individual `dll` (I'm guessing).  Then there's the whole SxS mess.

Settings are another mess.  Some can still be changed only from the control panel.  Some require going into multiple nested dialogs before the actual setting can be changed.  Each dialog was introduced in a different version of Windows.  It's like going back in time."

"Difference between x86, x86-64, AMD64 and x64","I am having hard time finding and figuring out the difference between x86, x86-64, AMD64 and x64. Here is what I understand so far

X86 - architecture developed by Intel
X86-64 - 64 bit version of x86

AMD64 - Intel was first to release x86 chips but they got sued by amd and have to give license to amd and amd was the first to introduce 64 bit x86 cpu and they called it AMD64

X64 - 64 bit x86 cpu maybe?

I am having hard time making sense why some iso are label x86 and work on 32 bit system and 64 bit while some are labelled AMD64 while still working on Intel x86-64 system.

Can someone clear this out

Thanks in advance","- x86: intel processor architecture, the ""x"" refers to the compatibility between the processor generation: 8086, 80286, 80386, 80486, 80586, Pentium Pro (686, I think the 80 was dropped at this point)...But nowadays it only refers to processor architectures >=486-DX as those have 32 bit address space (introduced in 386) AND an integrated co-processor for floating point.

- AMD64: You are right that intel first had a 64 bit processors...but afraid the rest is a bit...off. [The 64 bit processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IA-64) of intel was not compatible to the x86 line but more or less a ""new processor"". It pretty much flopped ;). AMD came up with a 64 bit design that was somewhat x86 compatible and that is the design used mostly nowadays...even by intel. That's why it is often referred to as AMD64...it is the initial name.

- X86-64: generic term for AMDs and intel's implementation of the AMD64 platform...so more or less synonym

- X64: Here you have to be a bit careful...sometimes used as short for AMD64/X86-64. But sometimes also used for a special mode of AMD64 processors that run programs in 32 bit address space but with access to all CPU instructions only available for 64 bit applications. (But the later is dying out so most likely it's used as synonym for AMD64/X86-64)"

Long time Intel/Nvidia user. Is time to consider a switch to AMD/Radeon?,"I've been using Intel CPU and Nvidia GPU for the past 20+ years and I'm getting fed up with Nvidia's Linux support. How much better or worse performance would I get if I were to get some top of the line AMD/Radeon combo in comparison with some current top of the line Intel/Nvidia combo as a high end desktop machine? I'm using Linux at home for work as web developer, but I also play AAA games on both Windows and Linux.


I simply don't wanna shake in fear anymore every time there's a kernel update just because I use Nvidia. I would love to have this gone. However, would I lose anything significant in terms of performance with AMD/Radeon combo? Even though I play resource-consuming games, I'm a casual player, so I don't really bother myself with some insane amounts of graphics quality settings or high FPS (I locked it to 60 in every game).","Whether they truly ""care"" or not is hardly relevant for the average user.

Could someone please explain what linux headers are?,Hey! So recently I was playing with dkms modules for nvidia reasons and I had a problem that got solved by installing the linux-headers package. I was wondering what linux headers are. Some google-fu makes it seem like it's part of the kernel itself but packaged separately. Is this true and what's the purpose of headers in the first place? Thanks in advance!,"They serve the same purpose as headers for any C/C++ code base. Assuming you don't know these languages, they essentially let other programs ""see"" what is defined in the library. Without them, a library is essentially a black box to a program that might want to use its functions. When you include headers from another program, the preprocessor is aware of what public definitions are in there, and you can compile your program against it.

It is more nuanced than that, but that is the gist in layman terms. It is difficult to explain without knowing how much you know about programming."
Is it possible to use ubuntu server to host my own free website?,"I'm so lost. I just want to have my crappy old pc host a website I can manage for free. But everything online is so confusing or costs money. Is what I want even possible?

Also, how do I make any sort of server to begin with? I'm so lost. I've been working for hours to figure this stuff out. Thank you


I won't be able to respond for a few hours but bare with me I'll respond when I can.

Edit: thank you all for the help and responses :)","I did the same thing. There are 4 things you need to make a webserver:
1. Deactivate DMZ
2. Port forwarding (80,443)
3. DDNS (free ddns services are available, create an account)
4. A firewall, it's VERY important for security reasons.
And my advice would be monitor your network once in a while.

Edit: power consumption: (someone who always keep their pc and laptop on) If power consumption is an issue and you want to minimise it, you have a variety of options for this:
1. You can use raspberry pi. (For personal projects)
2. You can use a non-gui based os.
3. You can undervolt your cpu.
4. You can disable dedicated graphics all together and so on.
5. You can use nginx server or for more ambitious and adventurous route implement your own web server all together.
6. You can change your power supply to more efficient and which meets the requirements (high wattage power supply are less efficient at lower power requirements)

You can implement one or more techniques to minimise your power consumption. I feel like hosting server in cloud and hosting a dedicated server are totally different. If you want to gain experience or something which costs more money to implement the features in cloud (it's usually modular, you get more features, if you pay more) (eg DIY NAS) or want more control (otherwise all enterprise would be using cloud services instead of dedicated servers), the later is preferred."
I am thinking of switching to Linux,"I was wondering which one I should start off with. I have heard Ubuntu and Mint are good places to start, so I as especially looking for your thoughts of those two, compared to others.

Also, because Linux does not support many games, how do I make it so that I can run Linux from startup, then whenever I want, I can switch to Windows to play my games.

Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!","Mint or Kubuntu look and feel more like windows out of the box.  

Linux does support a ton of games.  The only games I have had issues with are not with the games themselves but with anticheat software, most frequently with easy anti cheat.   You can check out if your games will run at [www.protondb.com](https://www.protondb.com) for Steam games (and you can also use Steam to launch non Steam games), [www.lutris.net](https://www.lutris.net), [playonlinux.com](https://playonlinux.com) and [winehq.com](https://winehq.com).  I'd say about 85% of the games I played on windows run as good or better than they did on windows.  A few required tweaking, and a couple just wont launch due to the anticheat junk (but the game itself runs fine, like division 2 and fortnight).

If you have a game that you cannot live without, you can either dual boot linux with windows, or install linux only and try to run windows in a VM.  Lastly I see there is a Shadow Cloud Gaming service that lets you use a windows based high powered gaming rig via an online streaming service for a monthly fee."
Why doesn't academia embrace Linux more?,"Given that Linux is a collaborative open source software project and that universities are generally known for adhering to collaboration and open standards, it makes me wonder my many universities use Windows as the most common operating system for university computers.

why is ubuntu hated?,"I see a lot of people online on YouTube and linux forums , reddit, quora etc., Talking that they hate ubuntu and prefer some other distro, why is ubuntu hated by ""elite"" linux users?","Here's a non-exhaustive list

1. Elitism. Ubuntu is easy to install and very user friendly, and some people think Linux is better off with a higher barrier to entry (that's probably not why, but I can't think of a better reason why having the option for ease would be a bad thing)

1a. It's the most mainstream, and the GNU/Linux community is full of a bunch of hipsters who like to do things their own way (not a bad thing)

2. Bloat. The current Arch Linux .iso (a distro known for being lightweight) is 786.3MB. The current Ubuntu (22.04.1) .iso is 3649.55MB. Granted, Ubuntu has a GUI installer... but you get the idea.

3. Corporatism. Ubuntu is developed by [Canonical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_(company)), a private company that makes $4.4 million a year (honestly not that much, considering the 505 employees). While not a bad thing in itself, there's an understandable distrust of companies in general, even though ones like Red Hat and Canonical have helped develop a lot of important shit like X11 and Wayland.

4. Snaps. Historically, they're slow, bloated, and handling permissions is a pain. What makes it worse is that the back end is proprietary, controlled entirely by Canonical. If you want to release your program as a snap, Canonical has to approve. Make a change they don't like? Snap, there goes your program.

4a. 22.04 shipped with Firefox installed as Snap by default. Removing it, then trying `sudo apt install firefox` will install the Firefox snap. Removing snapd and trying `apt` will install snapd, then Firefox as snap. You *can* get around this, but the fact you *need* to is unbelievable. Absolutely unacceptable. If I wanted to mess with system files so I can do an action I otherwise don't have access to, I'd use Windows.

4b. RedHat developed the flatpak system which has similarly sandboxed applications, but with better support for shared libraries AND the back end is open source. So if RedHat goes full Zucc, we can continue using Flatpak.

5. Telemetry. No longer an issue, but the Ubuntu installer used to have an opt-in option for [data collection.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/linux/ubuntu-reveals-desktop-telemetry-for-the-first-time/) Now, it was open source and everything, but ofc the Linux community is *very* against telemetry/spyware as a whole.

6. Spyware. Again, no longer an issue, but it was for years. The default option was to SEND AMAZON YOUR SEARCH QUERIES FOR ADS. [source, kind of.](https://fossbytes.com/ubuntu-20-04-lts-drops-amazon-web-app/amp/)

There are definitely others, but for me, the whole snap thing definitely makes me dislike Ubuntu. I still recommend Ubuntu-based distros for newcomers (and I myself use Pop!_OS), but yeah. Canonical bad. Thank god Ubuntu is open source so people can make it better."
Do all flavors of Linux default to the search field when saving files or is it just a quirk/annoyance of Ubuntu or possibly Debian flavors?,"As a user interface designer, I find myself as a user noticing quirks that make workflow harder, maybe even more than many people because in web UX these are details that can be tweaked. But I am not a Linux interface programmer so I have no idea if this is controllable.

On Ubuntu and Pop!_OS I have observed this in different tools- if you save a file and just start typing a filename, it pops into the search box. I haven't done an exhaustive comparison but it's starting to feel like a deliberate (poor) design choice that just goes ignored by app developers or perhaps can't be changed.  The logical focus should be either nothing (much less annoying) or the filename field (ideal). Not the search box because who searches for a filename when they are saving a file, honestly?  People just want to save a file, and if you happen to repeat filenames, the OS will warn you if you are about to overwrite the file. So it's redundant to the point of irritation.

I'm just wondering if this is a Linux thing or a Debian or maybe just Ubuntu thing. I'd like to petition Canonical to fix this if it's just Ubuntu.","that sounds like it might be a gnome/desktop environment dependent option or choice. i am using mint 20.3 xfce (based on ubuntu 20.04, but also tested on mx 21 \[debian 11-based\] with xfce) and  the save option of text editor (xed and featherpad), libreoffice writer and firefox all open writing to the filename field."

Any of your thoughts are appreciated.","If you're going to be running an up-to-date distro, then just about anything x86 based except Nvidia graphics or Broadcom/Realtek wireless, as you already knew.

If you're not going to be running an up to date distro, then avoid the latest and greatest from AMD or Intel, as AMD 4000 series APU's require 5.8 for FULL support (limited support in 5.4+ I think it is), 10th Gen Intel graphics apparently have issues with Debian (I've seen multiple people reporting this in the last week or so, thus far it's always been Debian).  But these work fine with up to date distro's, I have a 10th Gen i7-10610u working great with Endeavour (Arch) and a 4750u working great also with Endeavour.

Thinkpads are (generally) a safe choice.  And FANTASTIC keyboards.  Avoid EVERYTHING ELSE LENOVO.  Not that they won't work, they just don't support them well.  Tehy release them and stop releasing BOIS/UEFI updates for them even if there's existing firmware security updates from Intel/AMD.

Dell Latitude line is safe as well.  I've had unknown numbers of these through the years.  Generally avoid Inspirons.  They get less support with Bios/UEFI updates, and have more BIOS/UEFI issues.

HP I PERSONALLY have had very bad luck with multiple models both in the consumer lines and business lines, but I haven't owned one in 5 years now.  I've read about plenty of people who have them working fantastic.  YMMV.

I've actually had good success with Chuwi, the Chinese knock-off company.  However, I have read umteem million horror stories of others, so probably not something to attempt if you're not familiar with them.

Obviously the linux-specific manufacturers (System76, etc) will work perfectly.

"What are the differences between AppImage, Snap, Flatpak and the nornal deb files?","Hi all. This is my first post here.

So, uh, I got a question. I might sound a little dumb here but I'm new to linux so please go easy on me.

So, I know the basic differences like why flatpak versions are so huge and all... So what I want to know is do they also use the same memory and CPU power? My understanding is like since they are so huge they also use huge memory or something like that... Also which versions perform better since I heard somewhere that snaps take longer to open? Which ones do you prefer the most and why?

Thank you!","The basic explanation is that there are 2 main ways to install programs. 

1. To install them as part of your system, `apt` installs `.deb`'s and `dnf` installs `.rpm`'s inside your system. These tools require root access to function and without them its nigh impossible to install/uninstall software in your system.
2. To install the apps separate from your system, Flatpak, Snap and AppImage install apps separate from the system, the apps need to bundle everything they use instead of using it from your system, so they are larger and take longer to load. On the upside they don't need root access and keep the apps isolated from your system so they can't access things they aren't supposed to.

Once your program is loaded regardless of how it was installed it should perform equally."

Some are actually easier to install on Linux than Windows, like Lua.  As such, if you like programming you can almost certainly get a job working with Linux, especially web programming.

There's also system administration.  So many servers run on Linux that having in-depth knowledge of the OS is a good start on this career path.  Learning networking basics and automation tools is also pretty important.  Some services can be easier to run on Windows, like user profile management using Active Directory or email using Exchange, but a lot of other services are just as easy to set up with Linux."

How was Linux compiled before its existence,"Everytime i look at a tutorial about OS Development it says i need Linux / WSL and Gcc.. that makes me wonder how was Linux developed & compiled before it existed? i know it's a UNIX-based system but how was it developed and compiled before all it's existence??

I wanna know why people are relying now on Linux for OS Development.","As far as I know mostly on [minix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix). The gnu tools (gcc, libc, bash) already existed a decade before linux and the linux kernel was specifically written to run glibc. All that was needed was an environment that had a compiler (gcc) and minix worked just fine there."
Which Linux distributions are not GNU?,Are there Linux distributions that do not use GNU tools so not to be GNU/Linux but just Linux?,"There are a few reasons. 

For one, GNU is very bloated and slow. They've added arguments and commands that aren't part of the POSIX specification, and benchmarks have repeatedly shown they're slower than more POSIX-compliant alternatives such as Toybox and musl libc.

Another issue is, yes, licensing. GPLv3 is much more restrictive than GPLv2, and it's added anti-tivoization clause is the reason Linus hasn't updated the kernel license. Tivoization means hardware that includes a modified version of the software in it's firmware, which the hardware will fail to work if it's changed in any way. Linus feels this restricts product manufacturers who might want to include Linux in the firmware (and frankly, I agree, I think the anti-tivoization clause is an unnecessary restriction and really examplifies the third reason).

The final reason is GNU is **radical** free software. Richard Stallman has been repeatedly described as difficult to work with because of his strong ideals, and on the GNU website is an article called ""Optionally Free Is Not Enough"" which shows how strong those beliefs are widespread through the organization.

But if you're asking if Linux is stable enough, or fully featured enough for a windows migrant, then the answer is 'yes, in most cases'.

There are a few areas where vendors have chosen to offer their products and services exclusively to windows users. That could be a problem for you if you have windows specific job requirements for example.

But in general, yes, you can switch and live a long happy life without ever touching a windows machine again.  It's been almost twenty years for me."
"An alternative for ""Notepad++""","TL;DR I need a text editor (or note taking app) with good auto save so I don't have to save everything if I want to shut my computer off, or risk my notes cluttering my screen like sticky notes

So considering switching over to Linux and realized that Notepad++ can't come with me, I'm looking for an alternative. However there is a giant asterisk in the fact that I don't tend to use NP++ as a code editor but rather as fancy Notepad with auto save.

If I use  windows notepad, I either save it or it's gone.
Sticky Notes can and will clutter the screen and to avoid that you then have to make a notepad, copy that over and save it which at that point why bother with Sticky Notes.
And Google (docs) has enough information on me as it stands plus requiring an active connection

"I still don't quite understand how docker works, i know that it different to VM, can someone explain to me what is and how docker / docker compose work ?",Please explain it like i am 10 years old,"When you run a VM, you're emulating hardware, you create some virtual hardware and then your guest OS interacts with the pretend hardware. There's a layer in between the guest and the hardware. 

With a container, you're still in the same OS. You just have a box, where the program runs and everything the program needs to run is in this box. Inside the box are just normal programs running on your machine. But for organizational purposes, everything is kept in the box, the box is it's own separate environment.

That's handy because when there's a new version of the program, you don't need to install anything or change anything on your system. Just throw away the old box, get a new box, and run it. Don't like the new box? Throw away the new one, get the old one, and run it. Everything in the box is already set up, you just need to run it.

Isn't it past your bedtime?"
What are the most accessible and disability-friendly distros?,"I'm thinking of making the switch from Windows. The customizability of Linux is just too appealing. I have extremely low motor function and can only interface with my laptop through a single index finger tapping away at a trackpad. I rely extensively on features like a permanent on-screen keyboard that is available from boot, mouse speed/acceleration adjustability, and voice recognition compatibility. I mostly just need a machine that will allow me to play chess, Starsector, and CRPGs. I would also like to save up enough money to buy eye tracking hardware and software. 

From my research, I've gathered that Sonar was an accessibility-focused distro that was discontinued around 2014. Meanwhile, Accessible-Coconut is a still-updated Ubuntu build that caters to blind and visually impaired people. Do these come recommended or should I look into a different flavor?

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies! If you don't mind, I'm going to respond here in an edit. Based on your suggestions, I think I'm going to dual boot Windows for the voice rec and Ubuntu so I can tinker with its OSK and mouse settings. I don't rely on voice rec much, and I don't imagine it's terribly difficult to customize the OSK to run on startup as well as potentially work with some games; it would be sick if I can transfer most of my work/play-load to Ubuntu. I do in fact appreciate how dedicated Microsoft has been to accessibility on Windows and XBox, but it unfortunately doesn't mean much if the OSK goes buggy right after a fresh reinstall. Plus, they're telemetric creeps. Windows 11's jank-to-privacy-invasion ratio is too damn low to actually make it a tradeoff.","I know that Debian and basically any distribution that is keyboard focused has good to very good support for blind people. But with your level of impairment im not sure if U find a ready to go solution in Linux. Take Voice recognition for example. It can be very good either if you Setup Google Voice on your box or some free solutions but to be good they need to be properly setup. I know of none such distribution that does it from the get go. You would need to do it or have it done. That said I'm no way an expert on accessibility support in Linux.

You could try out talking arch Linux.

Gnome has better keyboard support than KDE. 

Also I would say test it out in a virtual machine first..."
Is there a way to download a copy of all packages in repos for distro and have an reserve repository?,"So, I'm from Russia and because of the president(I'd find a better word, but afraid of the FSB) in my country, I might have a problem in future to download packages. So, I started to think about making my own server with downloaded latest available packages(so, when I can updates them). The purpose is to have the ability to download latest packages in the situation when i can't fetch them from official repositories.

I'm currently using Fedora(it isn't a big deal to change distro, I just found it perfectly match to me), I know how to create my own repos here with yum, but not how i can manage this task.

It's not really neccessary right now, but I'm deeply afraid ""Iron Curtain"" from any of the sides.

P.S. I don't want to speak about politics, for my safety


Thanks everybody for replies, I think I'm gonna make Debian mirror(it's much smaller then Fedora's).","Mirroring is what you want.

What do i need to start with Linux?,"I have some old (between 10 - 15 yo) laptops gathering dust and i've heard that linux breathes life into these old machines but i don't know where to start, can anyone here point me in the right direction?","Note that while Linux itself might be faster than Windows10 on these laptops. These days most things users consider working software revolves around a web browser (youtube, facebook and so on) and these things require quite powerful cpu/gpu these days.

How does uninstalling a program work on Linux ?,"On Windows, when you uninstall a program, usually every file that was added to your drive gets deleted. I'm asking this because I was trying something on a Linux build, installed it, took some time to download and install, decided to remove it and it was removed immediately. I later tried to install it again but this time it installed almost immediately without downloading anything. This suggests that uninstalling the software didn't delete the packages it came with--it simply unlisted the executable files. Is this the case how uninstalling works on Linux or packages actually get deleted when you choose to uninstall (similar to Windows) ?","Just to be clear - Windows does __not__ delete all the related files when you delete a program. The uninstaller goes through a list of things and removes them. If the uninstaller doesn't say to delete a certain file, then that file won't be deleted when you uninstall."
Will any Kernel expert explain this to me please?,"So I rarely, if ever, post anything, anywhere.

After some googling I found that for whatever ungodly reason, I had to set the dirty background bytes for the kernel, to get it to fuction properly and copy the file.

"When native software isn’t available, why do we tend to try “emulate” the windows version? Wouldn’t it be easier to work off the Mac version since linux and mac are more similar?","I’ve probably used a bunch of incorrect terms but please bear with me.

I was just thinking from what I’ve gathered MacOS/OSX seems pretty similar to linux, and there are linux packages and stuff that have been ported over/works on MacOS that were originally designed for linux (stuff via homebrew for example). This made me wonder: would it be easier to somehow “emulate”/port over Mac versions of software vs Windows?

So for example, with Photoshop, it has a Mac and Windows version. Now I know that if you tinker with WINE, it will work ok in linux, but would it be easier to work off the MacOS version? And if so, why is it more common to work off the Windows version?

Sorry if I’m rambling on/don’t know what I’m talking about, but I’m interested in what you guys think.

EDIT: Wow, thanks guys for all the answers!","Probably the answer would be along the lines that of we already have a pretty good compatibility layer for Windows apps (Wine Is Not an Emulator) the easiest is to use it instead of reinventing the wheel and make another one for OSX apps. Even if Darwin is based on a *NIX kernel is still closed source, like the rest of the OS and that means a tremendous amount of reverse engineering to do which, in the end, wouldn't bring a significant benefit over using what we already have. I might be wrong though, who knows.

What is your argument for using Linux over Windows for personal use?,"This is pretty straightforward, just give me your best argument for using Linux over Windows for personal use.

I'm  a long time Windows user. In fact I've only ever used Windows. But I've been aware of Linux for a while and the  closest I've gotten to one is when I was playing with a Raspberry Pi for  a project. I've been thinking about switching it up and trying out a Linux distro, but I want to know exactly why people have been using these operating systems for personal use. What are the benefits and  draw-backs. For example: I hear people make a big deal about Bash all the time but I don't understand why, how is it better over the Windows default shell? What's the big deal about Linux servers? etc etc.

Thanks! I just want to hear honest wholesome opinions.

EDIT: Thank you all for your thoughtful answers! Most of these comments are compelling, I may try it out after all. Worst comes to worst I just go back to Windows, no big deal.","Computers are tools. I want to use my tools to achieve my goals. I don't want my tools to achieve goals for others. If I don't want my computer to render video from advertisers, I configuring it to not do that. I don't want to have to start from a position of my tools serving other masters and then working hard to get them to stop. Cortana and other phone-home features, advertising, DRM, crypto, and on and on are not for me. They are for someone else.

Hell, even the idea of licensing the software and having to sign a contract (eula) to use my own tools for my own purpose is distasteful to me. They are my tools. I paid for them, I built them, I will use them my way. I don't sign a contract when I buy a hammer, but if I did I'll probably learn to forge them myself.

"[History] Why didn't Unix-like system take over the world? DOS?! I mean, really?","Hello there,

I'm learning about the history of Linux, Unix, Minix and how it all started and I find it shocking how we got to this point and time. 

Rundown: Unix was developed in the 70s and code borrowed/sold(?) to some schools and companies. So copies started emerging. Some free, some not. The license was expensive and hard to get so people were looking for (and making) alternatives. As time went on, minix, BSD and Solaris popped up and other companies started re-selling the system. IBM, Sun and Microsoft (!!). Microsoft of all people was selling Unix system called Xenix and apparently was super popular. So people knew Unix environment and who did fell in love with it.

Then something happend and DOS came up. Significant downgrade in system capabilities. We're talking space shuttle and paper plane kind of difference. And the whole unix-like system somehow fell back to the servers and consumers have no idea it even exists. But back when, people were using minix and BSD was eventually freed and the aforementioned Xenix, which was one of the best selling unix systems..

From DOS came Win and we all know the rest.

But what happend? Is it all because AT&T was fighting the free clones? Or someone decided it was too good for the laymen? Or was unix-like system never used by consumers? What about minix, then? What happend? How did we get where we are?

Thanks for all no-doubt enlightening answers :)","You gotta understand that the first cheap computers weren't nearly prepared to run Unix, they barely got enough horsepower to run DOS. Unix was only known in universities at the time because they had the money to buy mainframes."

How to actually contribute to open source and Linux?,"Hey everyone, 
I've been using Linux many years now, installed Ubuntu when I was 13, and it changed my life as a tech enthusiast. Thanks to Linux, I got into coding and now I know Node.js, React/Next.js, and Python. If I had never switched, I wouldn't be a mini coder today.

Is it worth changing from windows 11 to Linux?,"I haven't used Linux before but have been thinking about making the switch for a while, is there a specific beginners guide that I should watch to make sure I don't make any major mistakes? what Linux distro can I install on my pc?



pc specs:



Processor AMD Athlon 300U with Radeon Vega Mobile Gfx       2.40 GHz



Installed RAM 8.00 GB (5.93 GB usable)



System type 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor



what tips do I need to keep in mind? as I said this is my first time (hopefully) trying Linux so I'll take all the help I can get","The biggest thing to consider is that Linux is not Windows. It may seem obvious, but many people come to this world thinking Linux is a drop-in replacement for Windows. While some things are the same, it is a different OS, so many things are different, and will require you to adapt to those new things.

Think it like this: It's like someone coming from using only iPhones to Android. There is no Siri, you get your stuff from a google account and not an Apple ID, and there are many brands to choose instead of simply ""the iPhone"".

This text talks about just that. It is an old, but still checks out: https://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm

Now, the biggest point whether changing is worth, is the applications you need. See, Linux does not run Windows .exe programs (not directly at least), which means that many programs aren't available for Linux. Many do, but mnay others don't. If the ones you need are available, or you are able to adapt to the alternatives we have over here, then go ahead, become one of us. But if you really depend on apps that don't run on Linux, and you can't adapt to our alternatives, then unfortunately Linux is not for you.

The rule of thumb is that commercial programs that require subscriptions (MS Office, Adobe Creative cloud, etc) aren't supported. In contrast, open source apps that are developed in part by community effort (Firefox, Blender, Audacity, etc.) do run on Linux.

At last, there is no asbolute guide on Linux beginners, but there are many resources out there. Probably someone have already answered your doubts, or posted a questionn you have before you and got the answer.

IMO, this video is an excellent introduction to this world: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAFvWdszwFA

If more dobts arouse, let me know. If you post the kinds of things you do or the programs you depend on, that would be really helpfull."
When did Linux become more user friendly? What was it like before that era?,"EDIT: I meant to title this as ""When did the Linux Desktop experience become more user friendly...""

I've only been using Linux since 2020, and since I tried it 4 years ago, it quickly became my main driver. I hardly miss Windows. There's so much greatness with open source programs and community.

However, there's a lot I don't know about Linux's history, although some folks have shared these experiences:

1. Driver and hardware issues
2. A time before Proton and WINE was able to help us play Steam games
3. A time before Pipewire and Wayland (I never really used Pulseaudio, I've mainly used Wayland since it seemed like the next best thing, as I kept hearing the Xorg was being phased out)
4. Printer issues (which is still sometimes an issue for me).

Fortunately, I don't care to buy the latest and greatest in PCs, so older hardware naturally becomes more compatible before I ever upgrade.

Now, I know there's a whole evolution of Desktop Environments, which is more about the GUI, but I figured the GUI has always gotten better in every iteration. I guess it could be incorporated to my question(?) There's just so many great DEs to choose from, hah.

But would anyone disagree that Linux is in a great spot to be more mainstream than before? Especially thanks to Steamdeck, Proton and WINE communities, and etc.

What was it like before this time? Before this era?","It seemed to get better sometime between 2003 and 2008 with Ubuntu coming in and supporting the deb-based community.  (Ubuntu was the Linux Mint of its day.)  I would also say that in the past, there were fewer GUI interfaces to do certain things and so you'd need to know how to use the terminal more.

From about 1998 to 2003 I was on RPM based systems (Red Hat and Mandrake), but at the time rpm seemed to prone to getting ""stuck"" in such a way that took some extra understanding to recover.  (It's fine now, of course.). I think the term was ""dependency hell"" and it was a much more real thing back then, sometimes causing the rpm db to have issues.

The main issues for me were hardware support, as I didn't actually buy hardware that was known to be compatible with Linux at the time.  I vaguely remember always having some issues with network support, and possibly getting X11 to work right.  On the network side you had to deal with ""winmodems"" if you were using dialup and didn't want to spend extra $$ on a ""real modem.""  On the X11 side, just manipulating the conf file to get the display to work in a reasonable resolution.  (I STILL have to deal with network support issues sometimes, but it's easier--I don't remember the last time I ever had a problem with the display just not working automatically.)

My memory isn't what it used to be, but I think around 2003 - 2005 I started moving over to deb-based systems because dependencies were just handled better and things didn't break as much.  But again, any issues always revolve around hardware support, especially network support.

I stuck with Debian for a while, and I didn't hop onto Ubuntu right away, but when I did things just started working better.  Ubuntu had brought some much-needed polishing to deb-based systems and hardware support didn't seem like something you always had to deal with after the initial install.  Ubuntu also contributed that software back to Debian.  For a while there (probably based on Debian free/nonfree policies) Ubuntu was definitely easier than Debian to install and run, but I don't think that's the case anymore.

WINE has been around for a very long time, but it didn't always have such great support for different software.  I remember using WINE soon after (within a couple years at least) after using Linux.

I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm mis-remembering anything."
Why is Linux so bad at handling OOM scenarios?,"Why is it that most Linux distributions just lock up indefinitely when the system runs out of memory? I know that there are programs out there that kill apps before the system becomes completely unresponsive, but why isn't this the default behavior?  Never have I experienced a system that recovered from this.","The OOM killer is the absolute last resort for the kernel before it panics, it will only get invoked if the kernel cannot find enough memory and is cornered into either sacrifice a process of panic.

That unfortunately means, it can trash for quite a while before it's completely stuck and invokes the OOM killer. If it can continuously pause programs and evict their code and then trash something else and reload it back from disk, it will do that. It was designed with the assumption there's some swap available to temporarily offload some stuff, but even then, that is also pretty slow and usually results in a lockup regardless. Well, it's not really locked up, it will eventually process everything, just ridiculously slowly. Ideally while this is happening, userspace processes are shutting down and will eventually free up enough memory that the system survives the incident. In practice you're OOM'ing because something is leaking memory so it doesn't really work out.

The kernel tries to not get too involved with userspace. There are plenty of facilities to ensure a program cannot ever use all the memory, cgroups being one. There's also userspace OOM killers that can detect the imminent trashing and kill a process, which being a userspace program, maybe it's got a list of things it can sacrifice first that are preferable rather than picking your database.

As with many things in the Linux ecosystem, a lot of those choices are left to the user, or otherwise the distribution. Ubuntu AFAIK ships with systemd-oomd enabled by default, or at least used to. On a desktop is makes sense to just kill Chrome, on a server it might be preferable to just wait a while for your database to shut down cleanly than have it killed and have to restore from backup. Or maybe it's a web server worker process, and it's better to kill it and abort a bunch of requests in favor of immediately going back to being able to serve hundreds of requests. The kernel doesn't know, you do.

This is a great article on the topic of swap and the OOM killer: https://chrisdown.name/2018/01/02/in-defence-of-swap.html"

Is Ubuntu Linux THAT bad?,"Hey, I'm planning to get into Linux desktops and the new Ubuntu 23.10 release gave me the motivation to do so right now on my secondary machine. 

I took it for a spin in a live USB and I pretty much liked it, but didn't install yet.  I did some reading on reddit and other places, and seems like Ubuntu isn't well received at all by the Linux community these days? Seems like the general consensus is that Linux Mint and Pop\_OS made Ubuntu obsolete, though that seems odd considering both are based on Ubuntu. 

I tried both Mint and Pop in live USB. Mint was fine, but I think I like Ubuntu's implementation of the desktop better, it simply feels comfortable. Pop meanwhile, I don't like the direction they're taking with cosmic desktop. 

Would I be losing anything by going to Ubuntu 23.10 instead of the usual Mint and Pop suggestions? I intend to go over to the next Ubuntu LTS when it releases. Or should I go with 22.04 instead of 23.10? Thank you for your time linuxquestions :)","It's actually just fine. It's still very popular, and for a reason.

Some people have problems with it and like other distros better, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't use it if it works for you and you like it. Even if we were to take the opinion of others to be important, you're focusing on those who don't like it — but Ubuntu is very popular, so many more people are happy with it."
"I see people constantly talking about, ""Wayland"", today... Could anybody explain what that is and what does it do? And what is it supposed to replace? Why are people so excited about it? Thank you.","I see people constantly talking about, ""Wayland"", today... Could anybody explain what that is and what does it do? And what is it supposed to replace? Why are people so excited about it? Thank you.","To add to this, there is nothing wrong with using X11 per se, but it comes with some historical architectural issues: the X server has to run as root or at least with high permissions, meaning that a vulnerability in it could cause your system to be compromised. Additionally, GPU-accelerated rendering wasn't really common in the 90s, so many X11 apps have to jump through hoops to fully accelerate 2D rendering.

Although Wayland solves both of these problems, it introduces mandatory VSync, breaks global shortcuts (by preventing unfocused apps from spying on your keyboard), and requires your graphics driver to support accelerated video and DRM rendering to be useable (likely an issue for people with a certain range of older Nvidia cards).

To see more examples of X11 weirdness that Wayland gets rid of, see things like Xft and the old style bitmap font names, or X11's built-in network-transparent mode (on Wayland you use a separate compositor for that, waypipe) .

Wayland is not better in every way, but some people find that it greatly improves their performance and/or peace of mind due to the added security. Older X11 apps can run on Wayland via XWayland, a semi-sandboxed compatibility layer that runs X11 apps as if they were Wayland apps, in a fully-conformant X.org environment. Some people rely on features that X provides though, and most apps will work on both, so if one doesn't work for you you can continue using the other."

I really  like customizing kde, how hard would it be to create my own widget or  something that involves customizing kde?","Look at the things that your distro of choice is lacking, or wish it had (and I'm sure there are plenty) and build them yourself."
What does * do in terminal?,"Often when I look for commands online you sometimes see * in file names and directory names, at first I thought its kinda like an autocomplete, so you can be lazy and instead of writing for example 'cd jim/Downloads/supercool-x64-x86-128bit-isoorsomething/' you could write cd jim/Downloads/supe* and it would auto navigate to that full folder name. 

But this doesn't work when I try it, What gives? What's it do?","in beginner/basic terms it's a 'glob' -  a pattern that gets expanded Into filenames  by the shell.

you can test with the echo command to see how it works.


example..

      echo *.txt

will show ` foo.txt bar.txt `

so `ls *.txt` actually gets expanded to 

       ls foo.txt bar.txt 

it's the shell that is doing the work/expansion. (a often overlooked  point)



there is much much more than just `*` for the pattern, the entire glob  system is very powerful and related to ` regular expressions` which are very much worth learning About.

"Old time (20+ years) Windows user, but I am sick of it. I need a strong Linux distro that can become my new main OS for work and personal use. What do you recommend between Ubuntu or Debian?","If you are familiar with Windows at all, you are definitely aware of their business model and how they push updates/software when it's not asked. A recent case was a weather/news widget bar added to the latest update without even asking the users, and it forces to use their crappy Edge browser and BING. That is just too much, I'm over this way of dealing with my personal digital space.

I have been testing Linux on and off over the past few years, but I would consider myself a super noob user. However I am happy to problem solve and find my way through common issues, learn to use the terminal more, edit system files, ask questions, etc.

I would use Linux for personal use and study/work, and I am aware that I will def have to make use of Wine for some Windows-only programs. But I would like to ditch Win10 from my system and only allow it as a virtual OS within Linux if needed.

Now, I also care a lot about privacy and I am passionate about free software, but I am not a maximalist. I appreciate the philosophy behind Debian, and I would love to use it as my main driver as I am sure it would be very stable. But I am worried that it would take me too long to get the system up and running to a good state before it being usable. I am also concerned about using very outdated software since in some cases I need to run new versions of programs for study/work.

For these reasons, I think that going with Ubuntu would be a better choice, with a huge community, a lot on new software available right away, etc. But I am also aware of the fact that Ubuntu is a bit bloated with preinstalled crap, it is probably a bit slower than Debian on average, and there have been concerns about privacy in the past, as I remember reading that some telemetry and other bullshit was running in the background in recent versions, which turns me off as it seems like it would just go towards the direction of Windows over time.

I am happy to consider other distros, but I would stay away from very small distros, or highly skill-intensive systems like Arch (I just read is not advised for new users) and I would also stay away from super commercial, bloated distros.

Any advice?

Thanks for reading all of this!","PopOs would be another choice from Ubuntu, also isn't Linux Mint the choice for ex windows for the look?"
Why do many distros maintain their own slightly modified version of the Linux Kernel? Why are these modifications not part of the main kernel?,Why do many distros maintain their own slightly modified version of the Linux Kernel? Why are these modifications not made part of the main kernel? Are these typically security patches or is it more than that?,"So the thing is that the kernel has by design like a bazillion configuration options that you set up before compile time. These options include support for all kinds of things - different file systems, usb devices, graphics cards, wifi/networking devices, virtualization support, and a thousand other things. I would imagine that most likely distros are just keeping a different set of kernel configuration options, and not really “modifications” to the kernel."
Does anyone know an app like Duolingo but for Linux commands?,"I want to learn Linux with an app (Android) similiar to Duolingo but can't find any.

I'm considering moving Apple/Mac to Linux. Will I hate it?,"Hey Everyone,

I come to you all seeking wisdom!

I made the jump from a Windows PC to a Mac back in 2007. I'm on a late 2016 Macbook Pro 13"" but thankfully I've never had the dreaded keyboard problem as I keep my computer in clamshell mode 95% of the time while I';m on an external keyboard and display..

**Where's I'm at currently:** 

It's time to consider getting a new computer for me as my Mac, hardware-wise, is getting a bit long in the tooth and slowing down.  Also, when I go on battery power, my MBP completely shuts down when I reach 38% battery life. I've tried to reset the SMC to clear that up to no avail. So I'm a bit sore on the whole planned obsolence deal because I can't simply replace the battery, add more RAM, and keep going. In other words, the computer feels like I don't really own it and just a rental.

I do like the MacOS itself, however, I'm considering jumping ship to Linux in search of something better all-around (hardware + software). I'm specifically considering a Lemur Pro with Pop!\_OS 20.04 because I love what I read about System 76 and how they tie in the OS with the hardware really well. That's one of the things that attracted me to Apple way back when because it helps create a better experience, in my opinion.

**My Use case:** 

I'm stricly a business/personal enjoyment user, meaning, I'm not a developer or gamer, nor do I use my computer for video production or photo editing tasks. I spend my time in Brave, email, and Word/Excel documents for which I use OnlyOffice desktop version as it supports docx/xlsx formats amazingly well. I have Zoom calls, browse through my Photos/iPhoto archive.

**My fears:**

I read lots about people moving from Windows to Linux which makes sense. Probably for overlapping reasons why people move from Windows to Mac. I'm concerned that moving to Linux will be more headache than it is worth and the end result won't lead to a better experience, just different, or perhaps worse even.

Is there anyone here that has left MacOS behind and can offer advice on what I should expect and ways to overcome any pitfalls coming from a Mac? I understand there's a bit of a mindset shift, but as the move better than expected? Was the juice worth the squeeze? 

Thanks for reading!","I wouldn't worry too much. Sounds like it'll be a piece of cake to install what you need, though I'd advise against Brave as they're now replacing ads from other sites with those of their own."
2020 will be the year I switch to Linux. What is your preferred distro & DE and why?,"There are so many choices and combinations. I think I've generally settled on Debian with the Plasma DE, but just curious what makes those that have been running Linux use what they use and why.","Whatever the current long term support version of Ubuntu is. It's not really that important to me which one I use, it's stable, and it has a large user base so if anything weird happens it's probably already happened to someone else and there's a nice tutorial walkthrough written up on someone's blog or at least a SO question and answer on it."
"From a newbie: If everything in UNIX is a file, then what is the ""character"" that makes the separation/beginning of a folder/new file?",Sorry if it sounds stupid or obvious and English isn't my first language sorry!,"I think you misunderstand.

""Everything is a file"" has nothing to do with the filesystem itself.

""Everything is a file"" refers to the fact that (nearly) everything can be accessed as if it were a file. If you're going to access a printer, the operating system is operating on a file-like object that \*represents\* that printer. If you plug in a mouse, the operating system accesses it through a file-like object representing the mouse.

Programmatically, that file representing the mouse or printer may be opened just as one would open, read and write to text file (of course your mouse and printer would want something sent to it other than text)."
"Parents of Linux, what are you using for your kiddos?","I have three girls, the oldest is 9, the second is six and the youngest is two. At the moment their screen usage consists of a couple of Amazon fire tablets for the older two, and YouTube sing along videos for the little one. The oldest also plays web based games on my old laptop that's running kde.

My goals are as follows:
Low cost
Low maintenance
Better content 
Better content management

I've got several games set up on family filter through steam, unfortunately they can't play different steam games at the same time, and steams local multiplayer is not idiotproof (haven't been able to get portal 2 to run local coop). 

What is everyone else doing?","I have a bunch of kids from 25+ to 10+. Most of the older ones are using Fedora and/or Ubuntu Mate. My youngest is currently on Ubuntu Mate for their main gaming rig and SteamOS for their gaming laptop. I have a grandkid that is getting his first linux gaming laptop this summer at the age of 6. So far we have Pajama Sam series (GOG) on there with Steam running Sega Classics.

One of my kids is currently dual booting Ubuntu Mate and Windows 7 due to their Master's program requiring a test taking application that does not work on Linux no matter what we tried.

When they were little I had them on Lubuntu/Linspire with a Windows XP or Windows 7 theme because that is what their schools had at the time that I could mimic but as they got older and built their own rigs they put the distros they preferred.

I did not let them get their own gaming accounts til they were btw the ages of 13 to 16 depending on how they preferred to game. Steam was family moded when I was on it.

My OWN gaming library is 99% local co-op/vs (going back to the 90's) and 1% SP games. I have a couple of custom cabs with fighters, brawlers, shumps and co-op platformers so they could game with each other or with me at the drop of hat.

The older ones play Xonotic, League of Legends, DOTA 2, Minecraft and L4D2, Shadow Warrior 2 all the time.

For local co-op, I highly recommend you check out GOG, Humble Bundle's DRM-FREE offering and itch.io's DRM-FREE offerings so that you can install them on as many computers as possible. Games like

* Dustforce DX
* MegaByte Punch
* Ascendant
* Crimsonland
* Curse of the Crescent Isle DX
* Jamestown *requires work to get up and running proper - https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/5yf5sn/drmfree_version_of_jamestown_can_use_steam/

and more were great for keeping the kids gaming together til they were OK with playing online with family & friends and eventually strangers."
"Someone made the ultimate menu plugin for Lxqt, opted not to license it, and just dropped off the face of the Earth. Is this common?","I am fascinated by the very simple story of [wing menu](https://github.com/elviosak/plugin-wingmenu)

Someone makes a Github account, does a few tutorial projects with Lxqt plug-ins, makes ""Wing Menu"", which appears to try and do what WhiskerMenu did for Xfce, just for Lxqt, and then vanished forever - notably leaving this apparently amazing tool with no license.

The users are fans.

The Lubuntu and Lxqt team are fans.

There's multiple instances on different forums of Lxqt and (or?) Lubuntu teams admitting that they're bummed they can't use/ship it as the new default menu due to a lack of license. [The lubuntu gang even chimed in on a Git Issue ](https://github.com/elviosak/plugin-wingmenu/issues/10)

So this tool, making Lxqt even more usable, just sort of sits in the ether. It's there. It apparently works great. But distribution is not possible and using it is at the user's own risk.

This being the LQ sub, I do have a question:

1. Is this common? Have amazing bits of open software been excluded from the Linux scene due to omitted or forgotten licenses in the past?
2. Are there any methods for asking this to become licensed outside of messaging the dead account over Github that are even possible?

Also, Elviosak, if you're out there, I'll totally buy you pizza if you slap a license on Wing Menu so I can finally use it.","If the license is omitted or forgotten, then it's not open source/free software. It's source-available software with [all rights reserved](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/). And it's neither common nor uncommon. How many homework assignments are out there in a git repo somewhere with no license associated with it? How many codepens, gists, and other things are floating around there with no license?

From a copyright perspective this means you cannot copy the code, you may or may not even be able to legally run the code depending on jurisdiction. The code is the intellectual property of the author and the author alone. Any duplication and distribution of the code would be a violation of their copyright if done beyond reasonable for fair use. This is why no one will want to touch it. For the code in question, since it's on github, you're allowed to make a copy of it via git and fork it into your own github repo, but anything beyond that is not automatically permitted without the author's permission.

The best way to think of it is think of the code the way you would a book. A book in the library is free for you to read, but you cannot make a copy of the book and redistribute it. Just because you can read it doesn't give you any additional rights to it beyond being able to read it.

So the answer to your second question is: Short of waiting 70 years after the author dies, nothing beyond contacting the author and asking them to put a license will help.

EDIT: I realized there is one other way to do it: If you're a multi-billionaire you can do a hostile takeover of Microsoft and update the Terms of Service of Github that forces all code to be GPL by default and make it retroactive whereby anyone who doesn't delete their repo by (insert grace period for after the updated terms here that help make the terms binding by making inaction a signal of acceptance) will be retroactively relicensed under GPL if no other license is present"

Probably a dumb question but do linux programs run the same on every distro or there are compatibility/performance/stability differences?,If for example i download the linux version of Krita or Blender or whatever from their site can i expect them to run the same on every distro? If there are differences which distro is the most compatible/stable for programs?,"Do not download anything from any site. This is not windows, use your package manager and you can expect everything to work properly, especially if you are using well-tested and mainstream distros, and as per your question, you can expect everything to work the same across multiple distros.

If you end up downloading stuff from some sites, then you can expect problems. Use your package manager, especially in the beginning, when you don't know the inner workings of the system.

If you are using special distros like Alpine, you may expect things to work differently, but then you wouldn't be asking this question, right?

Edit: it's not a dumb question, here we are on ""r/linuxquestions"" for exactly these kinds of questions.

If you plan on dual boot:

* Disable Windows fast startup
* Disable fast boot
* If you have a Dell, google this combo: Dell SATA RAID firmware Linux AHCI
* When you boot the live USB, make sure to boot in UEFI mode, not Legacy USB.  How depends on hardware vendor.
* If you have trouble shrinking the Windows volume, temporarily disable Windows' swap and hibernate.  Re-enable after the shrink.

Choosing a Linux laptop in 2025.,"Trying to decide between Framework, Thinkpad, System 76, Tuxedo or possible an ARM machine like a Macbook or Qualcomm.

I'm curious to hear people's experiences with using Linux on any of them.

All would be purchased used if that matters.","Would not recommend ARM at this time. It is not ready. Even on Mac while Asahi has come a long way, there are still issues, and you are still doing something with a device that is fighting you.

ThinkPad will be the best quality and works well on Linux. We use them for my company and run Fedora on them with no issue. Even the fingerprint reader works great on them.

System 76 and Tuxedo have suitable options. My only issue with them is their laptops are made by Clevo and Tong Fang who build laptops with varying levels of quality and are sold under many different rebranded names, which includes S76 and Tuxedo. Now, both S76 and Tuxedo do solid validation and testing on the ones they use, so it is not like they are putting out trash. They use their bios and insure all the drivers and software will work. However, I have seen where warranty work is often carried out by Clevo/TF and that is usually not a good experience. However, that is only if you have a problem with the hardware.

Framework to me, is a great option, but with caveats. Since they are designed around your ability to self repair, they do not have quite the quality feel to them. However, they more than make up for the ability to upgrade the complete system yourself and easily self repair.

Just my personal take and experience."
What is the Hardest Linux distro to use?,What Linux distribution is so hard it is basically unusable to those who are not extremely good with technology and have little to no patience.,"Linux From Scratch

Linux Systems Administration As A Job?,"So for context, I'm graduating high school in a few months and I'm looking towards getting into IT for a living.

Secondly, what are some negatives about going on the Linux path? Is there anything I should be aware of before going in that might dissuade me?

Lastly, if there's any assumptions I have in this post that don't make sense, or anything like that, let me know.  


Edit: Also forgot to add this portion, what should I look into for education? Are certificates through RedHat a good/realistic path, or should I go for a degree first?",">Would I be managing configs and services? Deploying applications?

Yes and yes. Additionally reasonable networking knowledge is helpful. Cloud infrastructure related stuff seems to continue to grow in popularity and likely won't go away any time soon so knowledge of Kubernetes or similar would be beneficial (if that is the direction you want to go).

>Secondly, what are some negatives about going on the Linux path? Is there anything I should be aware of before going in that might dissuade me?

Hm. I'm not really sure. I'm sure there are negatives but I've never stopped to consider them nor pay them any mind. A humorous downside is that I don't know how to explain to most people what my job is.

> Are certificates through RedHat a good/realistic path, or should I go for a degree first?

If you're already working on a degree I'd finish it but a degree certainly isn't a requirement (though of course it always looks good on the resume). The RHEL certs are definitely a good thing to hold though and they are respected and give hiring managers who may not be qualified to interview you a good bearing on your real abilities."
Currently trying to switch from Windows to Linux and struggling hard. Should I stick with it?,"I've tried to do this multiple times and always end up giving up midway. Last weekend I decided to give it another go and installed Fedora on my computer alongside Windows for dual boot. And the amount of frustrating things I have to deal with is so overwhelming that I am having a hard time convincing myself to stick with it. Issues I ran into include:

1. Nvidia. I installed the driver and it's mostly fine but brightness of builtin monitor doesn't work. I tried all sorts of fixes online but nothing worked so far.
2. HiDPI is a pain in the butt. I need fractional scaling and different scaling on two monitors. Wayland does it best but legacy apps look like crap, and getting it right on X11 took me such a long time, and it felt like a hacky solution at best (xrandr scale + GNOME scaling)
3. App installation is more confusing than I thought. I was under the impression that you can use things like dnf, apt, or whatever the distro provides and install everything that way. Now I'm seeing things like Flatpak, snap, AppImages, etc. I get the free/proprietary concern that some package managers have but the fact that there are at least 3 ways to install a thing is wildly baffling.
4. Certain peripherals require more attention. For example, my Logitech mouse has side buttons that are currently forward/back, but I want to change them to volume up/down. There is a Logitech app for this in Windows, but not for Linux. In other cases, a few things straight up don't work, like my fingerprint scanner.

To be fair, some of them may come down to just the learning curve and getting used to it, but the amount of effort I need to put into this has hindered productivity at work. They are not ""quick search online and you will find the answer"" like most people have claimed. They are time consuming tasks that may have no result even after hours of research. And to be fair, while I am no computer expert or anything, I am also not a noob that doesn't know what I am doing, and yet I am struggling hard. Not gonna lie it has made me feel really stupid and frustrated.

I don't want to be a hater but honestly it has got to the point that I just feel like Linux desktop sucks now. Note I said desktop. I have always been using Linux for server side and it is fantastic. Linux itself is great, and it's honestly the reason why I wanted to switch in the first place. Like many, I despise many aspects of Windows like the registry, data collection, and overall bloat in the system. But now that WSL does a decent job of allowing dev on Windows to be very Linux-y, is it still worth it to make the switch? I am just wondering if any of you guys have similar experience like this, and what convinced you to make (or not make) the switch?","> It's not a quick search online it's time consuming hours of  searching the web

I agree 100%. It's also why I use Arch Linux, not because I'm an enthusiast but because I'm a massive fucking idiot and man pages can be confusing at times and the Arch Linux wiki is the biggest lifesaver alongside Gentoo wiki.

I have bought a Dell XPS 15 9500 (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD M2, i7 10th gen) and I installed Ubuntu on it. Right out of the box it seems to be a lot slower than it was running on Windows.

* It boots at least 10 seconds longer.
* The Display is lagging.
* When starting Chrome I get an error message.
* Howdy Face Recognition almost never works at all.
* Touchpad Gestures do not work
* No kinetic scrolling in Ubuntu
* Apps take longer to start in general
* Also Shutting down sometimes does not work... Just a blank black screen with a white cursor in the top left corner

I am already thinking of going back to Windows. Is this a lost cause or can I do something to enhance my Ubuntu?

&#x200B;

EDIT: The version I installed was Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

SOLVED:

I installed Windows 10 again + Dell Support Assist. All drivers were installed automatically. Smooth and fast as hell. 

Ubuntu made me fell like I am running on a 10 year old machine. 

The reason I wanted to try Ubuntu is because I like the Terminal and I am enrolling in an Artificial Intelligence Degree and was told that Ubuntu would be good. I think I am better off with Windows + WSL2 or a VM running Linux","> It boots at least 10 seconds longer.

`$ systemd-analyze blame`

See what services take the longest to start up.

> The Display is lagging.

The i7 XPS 15 is only available with an Nvidia GPU, iirc. Historically, Nvidia GPUs haven't worked very well under Wayland. Try using Xorg. There should be a gear icon on your login screen that'll let you switch. See if that makes a difference.

> When starting Chrome I get an error message.

Could you post the error message?

> Howdy Face Recognition almost never works at all.

What is the output of `$ lsusb`?

> No kinetic scrolling in Ubuntu.

You should be able to change scrolling behaviour in Settings > Devices > Mouse and Touchpad.

> Apps take longer to start in general.

Are there any specific apps that take longer to start up?

> Also Shutting down sometimes does not work... Just a blank black screen with a white cursor in the top left corner.

This is probably because one you your background process has unsaved files that it is saving which prevents your computer from shutting down.

[There's some useful links in this article that might help you get Ubuntu working on your XPS 15](https://medium.com/@asad.manji/my-journey-installing-ubuntu-20-04-on-the-dell-xps-15-9500-2020-8ac8560373d1).

Dell also sells the Precision workstation version of the XPS 15 with the option to use Ubuntu instead of Windows. The manual for that laptop might have links to the necessary drivers.

If these instructions feel too overwhelming but you still want to use Linux, try Pop!_OS instead. It's Ubuntu for all intents and purposes with better out-of-the-box support for Nvidia GPU. Despite what other commenters say, do not use Manjaro (it's half-assed rolling release model is not suitable for beginners despite what everybody claims).

If Linux does not work for you, you should absolutely just use Windows instead. An OS is a tool, not a toy."
Security camera software for a Linux server,"Hi everyone,

Lately, I've been thinking about getting some security cameras for my home, and I'm wondering if anyone here has any experience with running a network of security cameras at home with Linux. I have a home server already, so I would like something self-hosted and privacy-respecting (I'm not picky about telemetry and stuff, but I would like to know that the security footage is being stored on my infrastructure and not in the cloud).

Any software recommendations? With some googling, I came across [ZoneMinder](https://zoneminder.com/) which looks pretty nice. If anyone here has used it, I would love to hear your experience with it.

Also, anything I should keep in mind when looking at hardware/cameras, or should just about any network camera do the trick?

Thanks!

EDIT: Thanks for all the recommendations so far! I've been reading each response and will look into all the options suggested.","I've used ZoneMinder quite a bit. I had a four-camera Power over Ethernet setup with ZoneMinder used to manage the video and as long as the cameras are decent quality, my guess is that you will be pleased with the results. The Wiki has good camera integration information. I ended up giving up on Foscam (not a fast enough frame rate) and going with Pelco which worked really well with Zoneminder.

Don't bother with an ARM architecture server (e.g. plug computer/embedded computer), the performance won't be there. I was very happy with a 64-bit Intel architecture Chromebox (basically a Chromebook without the display and keyboard) that I installed Debian onto. (Instructions for installing Linux on these devices are readily available online.)

I did some other stuff too that you might want to consider. I set up the Zoneminder server with two network ports; the one leading to the cameras had no route to the Internet, so I didn't have to worry about hackers or backdoors to the cameras. Instead the video is viewed/shared via the Zoneminder interface, available to me on the other Ethernet port.

When you really dig into the manuals, you can figure out how to get Zoneminder to send you alerts on your phone via email, optionally including a screenshot or video clip. You can also use this to immediately push videos off site  in case you're worried about someone breaking in and disabling your video security as their first nasty act.

I liked the software enough to donate to the project, which I rarely do and really should do more; but this one rose to the level of ""must donate."" I recently moved houses and haven't bothered to set anything up yet. But when I do, I will use this software again."

How come installing apps in Linux is so efficient in size?,"[https://imgur.com/DRJ16GF](https://imgur.com/DRJ16GF)

And the it will only take 844 MB of disk space after installation. Sometimes the net upgrade size is negative.",">I always get amazed how installing apps using command line is so efficient compared to using GUI

Huh... that's wrong. There's no difference at all in installing with the GUI software installer associated with your system package managers. It's just a wrapper that runs the commands for you.

What are the advantages of not having Systemd on my system?,I can only see the pros. I want to open my mind.,"Honestly at this point you have to have some philosophical opposition to it to want it off your system. It's feature-ful, fast, and so broadly used that it's well-tested and gets lots of patching, too. It solved problems that were hard, if not impossible, to solve well with sysv (classic example: old sysv init used sleeps waiting for devices, particularly disks, to load. systemd is event-based and fits the kernel's model for how devices get loaded, so no sleep/test sync points needed)

Most systemd opposition does come down to ideology. I'm not going to argue for or against these, I only intend to list them:

* Writing, testing, and maintaining scripts (imperative config -- steps to achieve) gives more flexibility to admins than configuration files (declarative config -- the end state you want)
* The systemd project has incorporated too many things and isn't UNIX-y enough
* Personal dislike for some of the key developers
* It's Linux specific, rather than POSIX, so our *BSD brethren don't benefit
* Other init systems tried to solve some of the problems systemd wanted to solve, with varying degrees of success, without straying too far from what's familiar

But in terms of *technical* reasons to prefer something else, I draw a blank. But that's me personally, and part of my bias is being a software guy who has a day job writing Linux server software. systemd took a good chunk of burden off our packaging/deployment by letting us kick scripts to the curb and provide a ton of features like cgroup resource management, auto-restart conditions, all that good stuff. I didn't have any horses in the race other than it solved pain points for us, and that made me want to use it.

Edit: I thought of a technical reason. If you're building a container image that needs multiple processes, you need an init, and getting a full systemd setup is possible but there are extremely lightweight inits to keep your containers simple."

Things like function keys (particularly display and keyboard backlight control), audio, touchpads, and even critical functionality like sleep/suspend doesn't always work.

The only major laptop manufactures that actually test their systems with Linux and provide updates/fixes to ensure it works are Dell and Lenovo (and then only for their business-line laptops).

Completely giving up on Windows ?,"Hey guys so Ive been playing around with Linux for some time both in a VM and as a dual boot with Windows 11.

It makes me feel secure / safe and most important I feel like I really OWN my PC ( as I should ) and my privacy is not invaded.

Manjaro broke again after an update. This time I don't even want to fix it.,"It seems like everytime I don't update an Arch based distro for too long (a few months), it will break when I update/upgrade it with `pacman -Syuu`. I never do weird stuff with my OS, I just don't use it for some time and then update it and it will break in some way.

Is it just inherent of a rolling release distro that I should update it regularly ? 
I thought Manjaro would not have this issue because I can choose a kernel and stick to it, but it's not the first time it happens  to me on both Manjaro and Arch.
At this point I don't even want to try and fix it, I want a new distro that doesn't break just because of an update.

The thing is... I really really like pacman and the AUR. It makes my life easier and I want to keep this awesome package manager.

So my question is : Should I keep using an Arch based distro and remember to update it often, or is there another solution ?

UPDATE :
Thanks for your replies !
I decided that I will :

- Go back to vanilla Arch (or maybe endeavour idk) and remember to login weekly to update
- Think twice before using optimus/bumblebee as it gave me trouble in the past
- Have a partition with a recovery iso on my hard drive, instead of having a USB stick that I never carry with me when I'd need it
- Automate slightly my install process/config to reinstall easily if it breaks too hard

Will the performance difference be significant that I should consider native packages over flatpak or is it negligible

How can I move away from Bash?,"I have no programming knowledge except for Bash. All of my programs are written in Bash, and I really like using it, but I know that I need to learn other languages like Python, Ruby, C++, etc. I just can't seem to pick up how to write in those languages, and I always give up and return to Bash. I love how Bash doesn't have to be compiled, I like how it usually doesn't have to be indented or commented, and it's so easy to get a prototype working because the commands are so simple and short.

Edit: Thank you all so much for your insightful replies. I've never posted on this sub before and I was expecting my question to be downvoted and removed because it's a programming question and not a strictly Linux question, but I was pleasantly surprised. I'm going to mark this as ""Solved"" because I think I got the gist of the replies. For people who may see this in the future:


1. Other languages are not a 100% replacement for Bash, and you don't have to move to another language if your typical projects are more suited for Bash. For example, system maintenance and task automation scripts are usually much simpler to write in Bash, while you may want to reconsider if you want to use Bash for developing games. (I mean, just look at this: https://pastebin.com/UKXNJJPZ, it's a 2D game demo that took me around 6 hours to make in Bash, and it only requires around 1 minute to beat.)


2. Bash is not well suited for very complex data manipulation tasks, and other languages will often complete the same job in a fraction of what it takes Bash to complete the job.


3. Bash is less portable. If you're planning on making a program that can run on all different kinds of operating systems and architectures, it's better to use a compiled language for that.


Edit 2: I'm now working on a project for GTK3 using Python and Glade. Thank you all again for your help.","python3 is your next logical step. it takes a lot of work, particularly when you already feel very proficient in one programming context or language, to get comfortable with a new tool or language. but that work is soooo worth it. 

all of the stuff that is a pain in the ass with bash is amazingly simple in python, like complex variable substitutions in strings or date stamps. however a lot of the stuff that is super simple and easy with bash takes a bit more typing and is harder to read in python, like kicking off child processes. the benefit is that it's much easier to orchestrate complex relationships between processes and get lots of information about them, and use that information in complex ways, very easily.

Edit: I know this sounds like something easy to find on a Google search but all that came up was ""HoW tO iNsTaLl uBuNtU aLoNgSiDe WiNdOwS"" and stuff like that.

**Final Edit: Gonna go with Pop! OS since this laptop was originally a nvidia gaming laptop. For regular laptops, I'll sell it with oem Ubuntu. Thanks guys!**","> When you boot the installation media, hit SHIFT to get to the installation menu, then hit F4 and select ‘OEM Install’.
When Ubuntu has finished booting install the system as usual, you will be prompted for a temporary username and password.

> When installation has finished, boot the system and log on with the temporary username and password you created earlier, you can now make any other alterations to the system that you want, for example installing extra software. When you’re all done just double-click on the ‘Prepare for shipping to end user’ icon on the desktop and then shut down the machine, it’s now time to take your image of the drive.

> Next time the machine is booted the user will be asked to set up their account."
"What exactly is systemd, sysvinit and runit?","Whenever I find a new distro (typically the unpopular ones), it always gets recommended because apparently ""it's not systemd"".

Why is systemd so hated even though it's already used by almost every mainstream distros? What exactly are the difference among them? Why is runit or sysvinit apparently better? What exactly do they do?

Please explain like I'm 10 years old. I've only been on Linux for 3 months","sysvinit, runit are init systems, systemd is a whole ”system layer” between the kernel and the user and it also contains an init system. What is better depends on specific use case and preference. The resistance and hate is mostly ideological and stems from systemd doing other things as well as being an init system. There are also some technical issues with systemd that get blown out of proportion. And of course the creator of systemd is a person that has had communication/attitude issues in some cases, and that gets used as an exuse to ”hate” the whole project, even the things he doesn’t or hasn’t ever worked on.

So if you don’t know what is wrong, you have no reason to avoid it. Just choose a distro based on what you need, not what other people don’t like."

ext4 vs btrfs,"For install arch, which file system would be better? I'm think the snapshot feature of btrfs would be better, but is it worth the extra set up time? Or would ext4 do

Would Debian be better to learn linux? or is it okay for me to stay on arch?,"Howdy! I set up an arch install and I am pretty happy with it, Though I want to learn more about linux and how it and computers work in general but I'm kinda scared about doing it on arch. after setting up arch on this PC i have sort of been just using it as a desktop for writing, gaming and web browsing and it has been a very smooth experience. but despite installing arch the traditional way I still know very little about all of the stuff you can do in linux, and I'm not sure if I could fix something if it borked

Debian has a reputation for being very hard to break would that distro be better for me to dip my toes into? or am I thinking to hard about this?",Because you have already installed arch just go on with it. Linux commands are the same in all the distors. The major difference is usually the package manager where arch uses pacman while Debian uses apt. I would advice you to learn Linux with arch
"Linux equivalent of windows ""Program Files"" directory?","I've been using Linux exclusively (except for some 3D design for 3D printing I do) for ages now, and I have a lot of things installed.

A few Questions about Linux Software,"1. Is Software in Linux also stored in a central location like in Windows where you would have ""Programm Files"" and so on...
2. What is the Linux version of a .exe file 
3. Could you uninstall programms by deletin the folder which the Programm is stored in.. If that is the case of course. 

I just want to understand how software is stored on the system to further understand the OS. To make a fulltime switch I need to understand how linux works and it would be very helpful if you guys could give a thorough explanation to my questions. 

Thanks in advance","Like with almost everything on Linux, there are no single correct answers to your questions that are true everywhere. The following answers are about the most common situation.

> Is Software in Linux also stored in a central location like in Windows where you would have ""Programm Files"" and so on...

No. On Linux, files are sorted primarily by ""type"" rather than by which program they belong to. Executables (of all programs) go into `/usr/bin/`, libraries go into `/usr/lib/`, system-wide config files go into `/etc/`, ...

> What is the Linux version of a .exe file 

Binary executable files typically don't have an extension on Linux. Their file format is called [ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format).

> Could you uninstall programms by deletin the folder which the Programm is stored in.. If that is the case of course.

Even if there was such a directory, simply deleting it would not be a good way of uninstalling a program (it's not a good way on Windows either). To uninstall something, use the package manager (assuming, of course, that you used the package manager to install it)."
The only thing stopping me from using Linux is good touchpad driver. Please help! I've tried everything😔,"I'll start with this: I HATE Windows. It's crap and I don't see why anyone who is tech-savy would **want** to use it (there are a very few exeptions). Anyway, I was raised using Ubuntu and have tried a couple of other distros, and the touchpad always sucks. It sounds ridiculous, but a proper touchpad driver with good scrolling, pointer movement accuracy and mulltitouch gestures are very crucial for my productivity. I've recently tried using ChromeOS on my laptop and the touchpad was way better (but had pretty bad scrolling), and the terminal wasn't Linuxish enough. I couldn't find xorg.conf.d on it. Anyway, the driver was ok, and [someone ported it to Linux](https://github.com/hugegreenbug/libgestures) on Xserver so I wondered if I could install it but it failed because it doesn't support current Ubuntu. Can anyone help me? Or perhaps suggest a solution (distro, package, I'll take ANYTHING!) for a proper touchpad gestures support on Linux? I'd relly appreciate it:)

Btw, I have tried:

Libinput-gestures
Fusuma
Touchegg
two Wayland touchpad extensions
Synaptics something

Deepin

ChromeOS and ChromiumOS (which were the best so far, but I want REAL Linux)

MacOS (again, not Linux at all and touchpad did't work well)



EDIT: 


Thanks for the suggestions. I know about [Elementary OS 6](https://blog.elementary.io/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/) but it's taking forever and I can't tell for sure whether it's good or not until I try it (since it's based on Touchegg with which I haven't had the best experience). 

Also, the features I need the most: 

- Functional smooth scrolling. Not the super fast that there's rn.
- 2-finger accelerated horizontal scrolling to go back & forth browser history. 
- Smooth pinch to zoom gesture systemwide (like on phones, not a ctrl± behaviour)
- App switching gestures
- Pointer movement accuracy in general (which's actually pretty ok).

[Here](https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/OS/Gestures) are the gestures the Gnome project has been planning on implementing for a decade, from which I have two: overview activation (not toggle, only activation with 3 finger pinch in and out) and 4 finger workspaces switch with animations that works great. That's all! (and only on Wayland)

And one last thing: there's this one guy who is probably one of the few who care about touchpad gestures on Linux more than I do, who is developing a driver (which's not perfect for now), and [here's](https://bill.harding.blog/2020/10/06/q3-linux-touchpad-like-macbook-update-multitouch-gesture-test-packages-are-ready/) his blog","What is the make and model number of the laptop?

Looking for a detailed explanation of the booting procedure & how Legacy and UEFI differ. Thank you.,"From what I understand a grub2 Legacy/MBR boot sequence works like this: 

BIOS checks hardware in POST and hands over control to first sector of a secondary storage volume. This is the MBR and contains the boot image. The boot image loads the core image which contains drivers to read the filesystem. The core image then loads the files in /boot/grub2. The Linux kernel is located and loaded into RAM, after which control is handed over to it.

The questions I have are:

1) What are the differences between boot.img and core.img? From what I’ve read online the sole purpose of the boot image is to locate and hand over control to the core image. If that is the case surely both of their tasks could be done by the core image if it were located at sector 0. 

2) How does a UEFI boot process differ from a MBR boot process?

3) What are the advantages of UEFI other than more partitions and bigger disk size support? I’ve heard it is more customisable and many parts of the boot process are stored in the filesystem rather than the “hidden” part of the disk after the MBR. Could anyone elaborate on this?

Thank you for your time!","You will find an excellent discussion of the boot process in the Arch Wiki.  The information relates not just to Arch, but other Linux distros and even Windows.

Should I use Linux Package Managers?,"Hello Linux People,

As a newbie to Linux, I'm still unsure about the process of installing/updating/removing software/apps.

I'm using Mint which seems a good option for a Linux beginner and coming from Windows, as it offers a desktop type GUI that I'm used to.

Using the 'Software Manager' as an example in Mint, most times when I find an application that I like, I see comments about an app being an old version and should instead use the Terminal to install the latest version (which seems to defeat the purpose of even using the software manager IMO).

Is there a Package Manager of choice that is recommended, or should I spend the extra time to install apps directly via the terminal?

Apologies for any terminology that I've got wrong, and for the basic questions that I'm sure most members on here already know.

Thanks.","The package manager for Mint is apt. Software Manager is a frontend to apt. If you install a program with apt you are getting the benefits of the package manager, even if you are doing it from the terminal. Mint frequently doesn't have the latest version of a program but, if the default version does what you need, I don't see the need to go track down the latest. Especially if it's a random download from an odd location. Mint supplies its programs via repositories and installing programs from outside the repositories may cause issues and you should only do it if you know what you are doing. If you have a question about installing a specific app from outside the repositories then it's fine to ask about it here or at r/linux4noobs. Edit: Thanks for the gold!"
How does windows 10 spy on you?,"Hello! I will try to make this as short as possible (TL;DR at bottom) I'm not sure if this is the right place for it, but I'm going to ask anyway! 

I currently use win10 and Ubuntu on my main desktop and only Ubuntu on my MBP. I keep hearing that windows still spies on you even if you deselect all the info gathering features on setup. My question is: How does spy on you? Why? And what happens to your personal data they collect? I'm not asking for a guide to disable these ""features/spy"" tools I'm just genuinely curious as someone new to tech and linux!

Why do linux installations behave so nondeterministically?,"I've had this experience with linux, from my early days in 2012 that some installations work and some just don't.

Once I had this problem with the fan running crazy and hours of searching brought no improvement. Eventually I re-installed the ubuntu version and voila! everything was peaceful as a Buddhist monastery in Antarctica.

Recently I had this experience with a kubuntu installation, and the screen was flickering, the docking station wouldn't work on startup and just be flaky. As usual, no amount of tweaking improved it. Now it's better since yesterday when I re-installed the same distro version from the same image, same flash drive on the same laptop with the exact same hardware.

I understand that hardware support is tough. I am a developer myself. But my question is why do these distro installations seem to have this behaviour determined by the alignment of certain stars in a galaxy far far away? Why isn't it a more deterministic system? And as a constructive inquiry: what can be done to change it?","In my humble and uneducated opinion, it’s drivers. Some updates are just plain broken for certain hardware.

People of linux: How do you set up your Android phone?,"I'm just wondering if you got some tips on the programs you use on your Android phones (keyboard, utilities, even ROM flash) so that it 'fits better' with your workflow.

~~I know this is kind of a general question, but I'm hoping to use more 'libre' softwares for my phone~~","KDE Connect is fantastic. Possibly the best phone/desktop integration currently available, between any two platforms. See notifications on the desktop, send files in either direction, remote-control the desktop from the phone, etc. It will even pause your music when you get a call. If you have a Linux desktop and an Android phone it's a must-have, IMHO. All of the above works already and it's still in very active development. Not all features require the KDE Plasma desktop environment (i.e. yes it works in Gnome).

EDIT: forgot to mention the feature I use the most: clipboard sync!

Termux provides a decent terminal and GNU environment, if you want to use standard stuff like openssh or rsync to interact with your Linux machines. There's a home screen widget available to quickly trigger scripts.

See also /r/fossdroid for general talk about open-source Android apps (not specifically focused on desktop Linux users, but I'm sure we're a large contingent there). Also the F-Droid package manager - even if you're going to just use Play anyway, their site is a good way to find open-source apps."
"I compiled my own kernel, why is it so huge?","I used [this](https://www.maketecheasier.com/build-custom-kernel-ubuntu/) guide and everything went well.

Why is it so huge when other precompiled kernels I've downloaded are usually at most, 100MB?","> except for the 'dbg' file, which is 700MB+. Does this also need to be installed?

The ""dbg"" file contains debugging information, only included for testing purposes. A production kernel doesn't include it.

What do fellow Linux users use to backup their files?,"Hi everyone

Being a bit paranoid about losing work, family pics, music I recorded, and more, in order to backup my files I use 2 external hard drives with regular rsync scripts to backup my main system to the external ones every now and then (approx 800 GB of data). I'm looking into adding one Cloud provider to the above, ideally something I can sync with using rsync or other Unix tools (in order to avoid uploading all the data all the time).

Google Drive offers 2TB for 10 euros a month. I saw OneDrive offers with Microsoft 365 licenses but you also pay for the licence, as well as NordVPN's Nordlocker who offer 1TB as part of their plans, quite cheap imho but you can't sync from Linux, and I got all sorts of errors because of filenames.

I'm currently looking at IceDrive who offer 3TB for 50 euros a year or a 450 euros lifetime licence.

Do you ever buy factory new laptops to run linux only on? What to consider?,"Preface: I have been a linux user for 7+ years of which the last 4 it has been my primary os choice. I would call myself fairly proficient in the linux ecosystem. However, my hardware has always been consumer grade, used hardware that has previously been a windows machine, on which I then installed a Distro of choice.

I find myself now at a point where I am willing to spend a decent amount of money on a powerful laptop. I will continue to run a linux distro as my only operating system on the machine. However it just seems dodgy to buy a $2000+ laptop with a preinstalled windows to straight overwrite with linux (Eventhough I haven't run anything but linux in four years).

"Why are all ""android on linux"" projects emulating android instead of reimplementing it?","Anbox and waydoid are running existing android images inside of containers (I know technically this is not emulation, more like a VM), why is there no project that implements parts of the android OS and run them natively? I believe the sailfishOS android compatibility did exactly that but only up to android 4.4 and was only available in the paid version of the OS. The PSVita homebrew community also made something similar, allowing them to run android versions of some android games on the Vita. MCPE Launcher also is doing something similar, it runs the android version of minecraft on mac and linux, so why isn't there a more general purpose compatibility layer like wine but for android? Linux still doesn't have a replacement to the android gaming emulators windows has, a project like this could be a good replacement. Most android games are just java programs that create a window with a canvas, and then just run the main loop in a native library. I think it would be possible to implement parts of the java and native libraries android uses and have a lot of games just work","I've looked into this and from what I understand:

Then we'll need an ocean of symlinks between /system, /vendor, /data and /etc, /usr and /var. Also there can be compatibility issues between bionic and glibc (or musl) unless we use libhybris.

In another scenario, the android runtime (that's like android's JDK and is based on apache harmony) can be implemented as a flatpak runtime for apps that won't need the NDK. Then we can recompile f-droid source tarballs using flatpak-builder and get android apps through flatpak.

Play services and NDK apps, however, are another story. They often use native code instead of JIT-compiled bytecode which can be extremely specific to SOCs, and therefore will need an android image to run."

What are the best VPNs for Linux?,"Which one are you using?

NordVPN

Surfshark

ExpressVPN

CyberGhost

ProtonVPN","Mullvad and IVPN are two very good providers that also work under Linux from my own experience. Personally, I would currently lean towards Mullvad, since their client is open source and they also regularly hire third parties for audits. In addition, I consider their prices to be very clear. 5 euros per month, no matter how long you use the service. Plus, if you want, you can actually put the money in an envelope and send it to Sweden. All what is needed for the assignment is the user account number. Nothing else.

I would strongly advise against NordVPN. A couple of years ago they didn't tell their customers for 6 months that one of their servers was hacked. In addition, a relatively important article in the blog was recently changed without further notice (https://www.pcmag.com/news/nordvpn-actually-we-do-comply-with-law-enforcement-data-requests).

Personally, I also don't think much of VPN providers, regardless of which ones, that offer referral links and run intensified advertising (on TV, for example)."

Importance of SELinux?,"I'm a relative novice Linux professional, but a long time enthusiast. I've made my way around the distro block a lot, set up a handful of servers for various tasks at home and to help others, got an informal education and ended up in a jr admin role. So I'm regaling a more senior colleague about my linux adventures as a youth and how I'd run a small lab on Gentoo among other things. He gets a kick out of it but ends with a somewhat serious lecture about how running anything without tight SELinux integration is very unsafe and should be avoided. He more or less says that Fedora/Redhat is the only serious implementation of SELinux and therefor the only distros he recommends for personal use even. I've implemented a kludgy SELinux on a hardened Gentoo before but since I'm not a security pro, I wouldn't really know if that turned out any better or worse than defaults on something like Fedora. I also have no way to really debate him about that or AppArmor.

Is this a popular opinion in professional linux circles? If not, what reading can I do in order to better educate myself on these subjects so that maybe I can debate him more effectively in the future? He seems like the type that would respect a dissenting opinion with research, showing I was actually thinking and applying what we talked about. OTOH if he is correct I might just be moving my home hardware over to Fedora and make my life easier, lol.","I use Red Hat. A lot. Professionally.  From the perspective of a system integrator, let me pose a scenario:

You're deploying a new application to a web/application server that has been delivered from the software team.  This is a black box to you, so you don't know how many injection and overrun attacks this application is vulnerable to.  Before you know it, somebody is escalating their privileges on your server running the commands through an exploit in the app.  They go for your shadow file and the password hashes therein to proceed to a rainbow table attack...and that's where SELinux stops them.  /etc/shadow can't be read by apache, even if it's running as root, because it doesn't have a SELinux label allowing it.

Now, should you have to depend on an extra security module to make up for your software team's sloppy coding? No, and hopefully you won't, but this is an example of how SELinux can shield you from zero-day attacks.  Layered defense is a real thing, and a very important thing."
"If Chromebooks are being sold more and more, will we Linux users get benefits from that?","If Chromebooks are being sold more and more, will we Linux users get benefits from that?","If Chromebooks sell more it will be because more people are buying laptops designed around not engaging with your computer beyond the most basic computing tasks. Furthermore, they are heavily reliant on cloud computing, i.e. for 95% of people, their data will be held and managed by a third party (a large corporation only aiming to profit).

I see no reason for that to have a positive impact for Linux."
Is it best practice to have multiple SSH keys?,"I don't fully grasp SSH keys. Are you supposed to have a different set for each device/service that you need to connect to? Or is it best practice to just generate one SSH keypair and then copy and use that everywhere, sort of like PGP keys?

Like I have my home server that I do `ssh-copy-id` on so I can SSH in using keys without having to type in a password. And also, security.

But suppose I wanted to set up SSH keys for something like GitHub. Should I just use the same keypair that i generated for my home server, or should I create an entirely new keypair?","I have different keys for different identities.

The keys I use to push code to different platforms are not the same (GitHub and GitLab are different keys).  My home infrastructure has different keys than my professional infrastructure.

SSH and Git has several things which make managing multiple encrypted keys easy.

* ssh has Match config and ssh-agent which makes key management across systems easy.
* Git has sshCommand and includeIf to make managing multiple identities with different SSH keys easier.

I wrote the [`git idm` transport for identity management](https://github.com/samrocketman/git-identity-manager).

Once the tools are learned managing it becomes pretty easy IMO."
Anti virus for Linux?,"I know, I know. Linux doesn't need an AV (Antivirus) but just in case anyone wanted one they could use this for reference so comment your preffered Anti Virus/es.","I'd rather spend time *actually* being helpful.   Kids, listen to your parents and don't do antivirus.

Why not?

* Your time would be better spent on other more effective hardening tools, like a security audit scanner, like Lynis.
* AV products have been found to be [spying on users](https://www.howtogeek.com/540658/is-your-antivirus-really-spying-on-you/).
* AV realtime scanning has been found to open up the kernel to attacks and vulnerabilities.
* AV realtime scanning will slow your machine and increase RAM usage.
* The entire premise of AV is flawed.  It tries to detect an app that might cause damage usually due to a security hole in un-patched software.  It is better to prevent the possibility of damage through frequent updates from trustworthy centrally curated repos.

It's rare for me to install a downloaded file like a .deb, but if I must I'll pass the URL to [virustotal.com](https://virustotal.com) first.   But instead I will use trustworthy alternative repos like Nix, Homebrew, and Flathub to avoid ever having to do that.

All that said, a *static* scan using a product known to be trustworthy can't hurt.   I am just very distrustful of commercial AV realtime scanning.  Also, AV may be necessary for Windows files if you are running a mail server or Samba share.  Just be careful."

"How did people install operating systems without any ""boot media""?","If I understand this correctly, to install an operating system, you need to do so from an already functional operating system. To install any linux distro, you need to do so from an already installed OS (Linux, Windows, MacOS, etc.) or by booting from a USB (which is similar to a very very minimal ""operating system"") and set up your environment from there before you `chroot` into your new system.

Back when operating systems weren't readily available, how did people install operating systems on their computers? Also, what really makes something ""bootable""? What are the main components of the ""live environments"" we burn on USB sticks?


Edit: 

Thanks for all the replies! It seems like I am missing something. It does seem like I don't really get what it means for something to be ""bootable"". I will look more into it.","The answer to your question would have to reach back into the primordial soup of computer science / microprocessor technology.

First CPUs ran code from a flash  memory (or actually from a strip of paper) that was connected to them and period. from there the ecosystem grew.

New technologies got software that was developed with some older technology (keyword cross compiler)…

Are independent distros dying?,"Hi, I've used quite a few linux distros in the last ~2 years and settled on EndeavourOS KDE. The underlying base distro of EndeavourOS, ie Arch Linux, had an out-of-date toolchain issue for many months. Though it has been temporarily solved, the new maintainer is learning while in charge of maintenance. This signals a lack of community involvement in maintaining distros and software, despite the growing linux user base.

Now the issue is that distros based on Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat and SUSE get toolchain and other critical updates from commercial companies, but they're managed by independent volunteers in others. Therefore distros like Mageia, OpenMandriva, PCLinuxOS, Solus are likely to face similar problems in the near future when maintainers leave. When larger independent distros like Arch are already encountering this phenomenon, how likely is it that smaller ones won't cease to exist after a similar issue?","There has always two tiers of distributions: ones that have a track record, large community, and support be it a company like SuSE or a foundation like Debian, and everyone else. If you use one of the tier 2 distros, you have a greater likelihood of it going away at some point."
Making sure that an untrusted USB drive only acts as storage,"Hey!

This isn't an issue that comes up often, but I need it sometimes.

Every once in a while, I exchange some files on a pendrive with friends. Now, some of them are kind of script kiddies, and I totally expect them to one day give me a USB stick that pretends to be a keyboard or whatever.

So, my question is, is there a way to connect a USB drive whilst making sure that it can only ever be treated as storage device, and nothing else?

I'm not afraid of the terminal, but would prefer not to have to do complicated rituals every time (but if it's scriptable then it's okay).

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance for reading!

Edit: I almost forgot to mention that I'm on Manjaro at the moment, but plan to move to either void, arch, artix or pop in the not so distant future, so something that is more or less portable between distros would be great.","TL;DR: You don't. 

In any security context, you asses your attack surface, threat model, and risk. Your attack surface for this engagement is a USB device. The threat model are bored teens. The risk is probably shenanigans, they probably aren't going to give you a USB killer. 

Given these assumptions, low risk, medium threat, I would use a fresh Kali image on a Rasbery Pi. Depending on how paranoid I was feeling, and what I was expecting on the disk, I might just run foremost to extract files, or I might run a filesystem dump utility to individually read the files out, with a tool like libguestfs, anything to avoid mounting it. If I had to mount it, I'd force fsck it, I'd use the nosuid, nodev, noexec, noatime, and nodiratime flags, and maybe force UID and GID to a guest account if the file-system supports owner overrides. I'd run a `file -k` on every file I wanted, paying close attention to anything that came back with more than one type. 

Edit: more thoughts: Get the files off quick, and get the USB out of your system ASAP. Don't give it time. Also, be SSHed into the RasPi, so any keystroke attacks are against a text login screen, no opportunity to do anything from a desktop or command line.

But in a real security situation, high risk, high threat, you wouldn't. You'd toss the drive out. If you had to know what was on it for serious reasons with an advanced threat actor, you would use throw away equipment that was air gapped or dissect it."
"I have basic Bash skills and I know almost nothing about coding, what is the distribution for me?","Here's some clarifications.

So I was wondering whether I should get a more user-friendly dist like Ubuntu or Manjaro, or should I bite the bullet and get a more advanced version like ArchLinux and its variants. Sorry for any misuse of words I am still very new to Linux.","People who do that are morons, pardon my language. Nothing is wrong with more user-friendly distros."
Can anyone recommend an HDMI capturing dongle that works like a webcam on Linux?,"I'm totally blind and would like to record myself coding to hopefully motivate other people, blind and sighted, to learn to code as well.  My primary operating system is MacOS, and although I've used Linux exclusively in the past and even worked on a fork of the kernel for a PDA in the early 2000s, I'm completely out of the loop now since I haven't used Linux natively for over a decade, and my only contact with Linux these days is through local Docker containers that I'm using for development.

Although it's possible to record the screen on MacOS, there is no way to also record sound without using third-party software such as Loopback, Blackhole, or Soundflower, the first of which is paid and quite expensive for what it does, and the latter two require the use of an aggregate device which sends output at half the volume for some reason, so I'm thinking about buying a Raspberry Pi and an HDMI capture USB dongle to solve the problem using hardware.  I've found devices priced as low as $10 whose reviewers claim to work on Linux, but I want a device that can sustain recording at 1080p at 30fps minimum for long periods of time without overheating and throttling, and that has a Video 4 Linux driver that I can use with FFmpeg as if it was a webcam.

Can anyone recommend anything?

Thanks in advance!","I use an elgato hd60+. Discord and OBS thinks it's a webcam so I assume anything would.

BOUNTY OFFERED: Help Me Solve a Linux/AlsaMixer os.system() command issue,"SOLVED!!!!  THANKS!  I am contacting the winner!  u/glesialo was the first one with a single-line command using pacmd (or pactl but I went with pacmd because more options if I ever need them).  I embedded that line in an os.system(pacmd suspend-source 1 1|0) on either side of the Speech Synthesizer output and it plugs the robot's ears and unplugs them perfectly.

VIDEO THAT EXPLAINS THIS BETTER:  https://youtu.be/oDgphapTRhM

SYSTEM DETAILS YOU NEED TO BE FAMILIAR WITH: Operating System: Linux (Raspberry Pi OS 64) running on a Raspberry Pi 4B 8 gig, with Python 3.7.3, and AlsaMixer 1.1.8 

BOUNTY OFFERED: First person whose suggestion is accepted and works gets, if you're of age, and permitted legally in your locality and desired, a 12 year old bottle of Glenfidditch or Macallen, your choice, or $75.00, plus the satisfaction of knowing you really helped me keep what's left of my hair. Read below carefully and fully for details. 

PROBLEM PART A: When my robot speaks, it's speech recognition script picks up its own speech and attempts to respond to that, creating a feedback loop and making it difficult to get a word in edgewise. 

WHAT I'VE TRIED PART A: I'm issuing an os.system amixer sset command to drop 'Capture' to 0 when the robot speaks, and returns 'Capture"" to full (65535) after the speech is complete. According to AlsaMixer and other audio programs that listen to the Mic input, this works perfectly. 

PROBLEM PART B: When the Speech Recognition script runs with the above remedy implemented, I get exactly ONE cycle of Listen-Send Speech-Listen, and that's it. The script doesn't die, no errors, it just listens to either actual or software-induced silence, and never (or only rarely, even more frustrating) returns any more recognized speech. 

WHAT I'VE TRIED PART B: The Speech Recognition scripts I use are from PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecogn...) and they are nearly flawless. I *do not* believe that the Speech Recognition script is the issue, but I started there to try to pinpoint the problem. I peppered the imported __init__.py script (the actual workhorse of the Speech Recognition system) with print statements at various points, and I've discovered that after it goes through ONE listen-report-listen cycle, it stops on that subsequent listen, ONLY when the Mic volume control statement has been issued in the interim. Without the Mic volume command, it's just does the listen-report-listen cycle perfectly, with the exception of Problem A above - hearing and responding to itself. 

ALTERNATE OPTIONS: The only other solution I can think of is a hardware solution, and I can't believe with all we can do in Python and Linux that I should have to resort to that, but I also have a script that mutes the actual mic signal using an analog switch - literally disconnecting and reconnecting the mic input signal right at the source. I will not consider a hardware solution to this issue for the bounty. This in Python, on Linux. There's a line of code for this. Somewhere. A group ownership/permissions change - something... 

WHAT I WILL NOT CONSIDER AS AN ACCEPTABLE OPTION: Any 3rd-party black-box software; Any hardware solution suggestion (already have that); any unnecessarily contorted script. This is already *mostly* working. As you will see in the video, AlsaMixer sees the audio controls and all of that works well. What *seems* to be happening is that once the control is sent to adjust the Mic volume, something about the Speech Recognition scripts' *connection* to the Mic seems to be broken. Only stopping & restarting the script restores the function - until the very next time the mic volume command is sent. The winning suggestion will be the one that correctly identifies exactly what the problem is and provides the exact steps to fixing it. It doesn't even have to be code, it can be a settings change/permissions change, group ownership change... but I know in my heart that it will be simple. 

Good luck!","Couple of things, do you have an example script that displays this problem? Specifically what commands are you calling and how are you looping. What is the exact line of code it's stopping on (I guess your capture code?)

Anyways, my first guess is what is it supposed to be waiting on to finish? If I had to guess it sets up some impossible trigger after being initialized with the microphone off, and then never returns. This would be very helpful to fire up a debugger and trace it through the code (is it spinning, high CPU when this happens?). Does this problem happen if you don't set the capture volume to  0? What if you use mute/unmute instead of specifying a volume?

Second, are simply changing the volume when listening? Have you tried stopping and starting it, does that change the outcome?

And what about not using alsamixer, specifically, most things use pulse now, so have you tried changing the microphone with pavucontrol. Did you specify the input methods?

And finally, if this was me I'd probably attempt to filter the input and remove the output from the input (I'd probably put the speech output through a few narrow bandpass filters with the reverse filter on the input), then you can talk to it while it's talking and it can understand over its own voice."
Why can ChromeOS provide a good touchscreen experience but normal Linux distros can't?,"**DISCLAIMER**: This post isn't a war declaration, It's a legit question.

Last time I tried Linux on a touchscreen a few months ago I remember that the experience wasn't smooth. When you rotate screen turns off instead of having a smooth animation, the OS can't follow well my finger and there is significantly more delay than on Windows, no dedicated tablet mode and so on.

Yet, I tried a chromeOS device recently too and I was stunned at the touchscreen experience It provided. It could be comparable to an iPad or an Android tablet that's how good It was.

ChromeOS is based on Linux. So why can't Linux distros implement a good touchscreen experience too?","Chrome OS knows exactly which hardware it's been made for and can be optimized on a device by device basis.

how do i learn more about linux,"I have been using linux for a while now but i would say i'm still very noobish. I have tried Ubuntuand Manjaro kde however i feel my terminal skills and linux knowledge are still very noob.

&#x200B;

i thought of a few things and would like some thoughts on what i should do.

&#x200B;

1. create a separate home dir so that i can try different distros and wms

2. try a wm such as i3

3. the linux from scratch (on a vm because i dont want to do this on a main pc unless i have too)

4. install a minimal debain or ubuntu server iso and then config it to have a de or wm plus other things

&#x200B;

I'm not quite sure where to start when learning these things.","Honestly, the things you've listed are solid things to try out. As for improving your terminal skills, time and actually using it are the key. Babysteps are valid approaches.

Need to go into a folder? Enter your filebrowser's name and the path in the terminal, just for the sake of using it. Don't use the integrated graphical app stores of your distro, use the command line alternatives. Start reddit in your browser by entering <yourbrowser> reddit.com.
Edit small text files or configs with nano or vim in the terminal.
Use wine in the terminal to install and start winamp. Google useful hotkeys for the terminal (Like the basic one to hit tab to complete what you're typing)
Seriously, actually using the commandline is the best way to get to know it. And there are plenty of guides out there, I'd assume.


Experiment and don't be afraid to fuck up. Yaddah yaddah backups and stuff, obviously. Using linux distros is the best way to learn. If you hit a roadblock, try getting it to work. Consume guides like free cookies.

And when you feel courageous, install Arch and Gentoo blindly and hit a random article on the arch wiki and implement that. It's utter nonsense, but quite an adventure, hah!"
"Why did Debian/Ubuntu based distros actually become the ""default"" distros for newbies and general support?",This is especially blatant when looking for downloads of popular proprietary software that supports Linux like Discord.,"Three big reasons:

1. Debian is an extremely robust distro. No other distro has as many packages as Debian does, and it's actually *shrunk* in the last decade. So there was always a gigantic amount of software choice. For instance few other distros allowed you to pick whichever DE you wanted no issues. This makes it easy for software packagers, because if you need a dependency, chances are its already in the repo and you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

2. It was a binary distro, which coupled with 1 made it really easy for new users to get into: you just download the packages and go, at a time when a lot of other distros required compiling a lot of stuff yourself manually, which was a big barrier to entry. This is less of a big deal these days, but it causes a lot of inertia.

3. Canonical and Ubuntu. And, despite the flak they often rightfully get, this is the biggest one. Canonical put a metric *fuckton* of effort into making a new-user-friendly distro based on Debian. Many quality-of-life things that are easy to take for granted these days were due to Canonical actually putting in the effort. And thus, it became a huge base of users from which sprang many dozens of child distros which brought even more new users in. I got my start with Linux in 2007 with Ubuntu 7.10, and have been a Debian user continuously on everything (every daily driver device, home and work) since 2013. Had it not been for Ubuntu 7.10 and especially 8.04 with some major QoL fixes, I probably wouldn't have tried Linux, and I'm certain I'm not alone there. And when ""The Cloud"" became a thing, Canonical was at the absolute forefront of providing cloud images and getting Ubuntu Server as the default basically everywhere."

> Why are so many commands for some simple tasks like powering off the system?

You will actually find that `shutdown`, `poweroff`, `reboot`, `halt`, `telinit`, and so on, are all just symlinks to `systemctl`. This is because historically, before systemd was a thing, different Unix and Linux systems used a variety of different commands for these tasks. `systemctl` knows when it's being run through these symlinks and will act in the same way these commands used to work."
how do you get the most out of Linux?,"I mean, what's your workflow and your favorite programs? What are the first programs that you add to a new Linux installation?

I use a keybind to change my wallpaper and when I do that, it also changes the color scheme based on that image. 
- I use qutebrowser because of the vi-like keybinds, even though I can easily switch to chrome or Firefox if for some reason I have to do it. Also, it's a little bit frustrating to forget to use the Insert text command and mess it all when trying to type something, so I'm using more chrome or Firefox than qutebrowser.

"Why do open source projects use ""ugly"" forges to host their repo ?","Hi ! This may be a dumb question. 

I was wondering why some (major) open source projects are hosted on old forges. I am thinking of KiCAD, the kernel, Gnu Privacy Assistant, etc. They do have mirrors on Github, but these are *just* mirrors. 

It is not only the UI I am inquiring about, but also the process. These keep the ""mailing list"" method to share code & bugs, but as someone who would like to contribute, I find this way of collaborating quite intimidating compared to merge/pull requests with discussion threads & labels. 

Could someone maybe explain to me the pros & cons of such a development process ? 

Thanks to the community !","Mailing lists are a good way to keep organized. They are archaic but it works well, and they have their entire process built around them. Why change something that works for them?

How do I start contributing to Linux projects?,"I have a fair bit of programming skill and I want to make a difference in the Linux community, but reading someone else's code for huge Linux projects sounds like a nightmare. Where do I get started? Do people make documentations for these projects?","> I have a fair bit of programming skill and I want to make a difference in the Linux community, but reading someone else's code for huge Linux projects sounds like a nightmare.

I've contributed bug fixes to a number of projects. Guess what? _You don't need to read the whole code._

Pick a program you use that has a bug that really annoys you. Make sure that bug is small, simple and tractable &mdash; the trick here is to be _really_, _really_ picky so that even the slightest annoyance (e.g. ""the `--help` output is badly formatted"") is a bug worth fixing. Grab the program's code, make sure you can compile it and run its test suite, then start working on the fix. Find out how the project wants bugfixes submitted. Once you've got a fix, submit it!

Drive-by contributors are really not expected to do more than this. Of course, if you enjoy working on a project you may end up making larger contributions. But there's nothing wrong with starting small!

My first open-source contribution was back in 2001: a couple-of-lines patch to [esound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightened_Sound_Daemon) to fix some problems it had when pushing audio over a TCP socket. I'd already done some networking programming before, so it was reasonably easy to identify and fix the issue (it didn't handle short socket reads properly). Did I have any idea how any of the rest of the program worked? Not at all! I knew I could fix one problem without needing to know how the rest of it worked."

Been away from Linux for many years,"I’ve been away from Linux since maybe 2013. I enrolled in a non-tech graduate program that required windows.

Should I use Linux on my laptop?,"Hello Guys,

I was wondering if I should use a Linux Distro on my Laptop (I was thinking about Elementary OS for his look and simplicity). My Laptop is the MEDION Akoya E229x and here some specs:

* Processor: Intel Pentium Silver N5000 1.1Ghz 1.1Ghz
* RAM: 4GB
* 64Bit Operative System
* Tablet Mode
* SSD: 64 GB

I would really like to use a Linux Distro because I hate the way Windows looks and works but on the other hand I use this Laptop for school with programs like Brackets and Word (which can be replaced easily with Brackets or Atom for Linux and Libre Office) and some Adobe products such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. I know there are for sure some free programs similar like GNOME and so on for the Adobe programs but I never tried them so I'm not sure if they'll suit for my job. I'm even ""scared"" because of the 64GB SSD, it's not that much. I would even like to know if there's a way to have still the tablet mode on a Linux Distro.

I've already used Ubuntu, Lubuntu and Manjaro on my PC and my old Laptop so I know how to use it and where to search for troubleshoots but I don't use the old Laptop anymore because it's only 32Bit and very slow. My PC must definitely run Windows because I play games there so the question is if Linux will fit my purpose on this Laptop.

Controversy about whether Android is Linux or not.,"Sorry if this is a stupid question, I find myself very confused over whether Android is Linux or not. Sure it uses the Linux kernel but I'm confused about whether the stock OS that you get when buying for example a Samsung phone is open-source as well since the Linux kernel is provided under  GPL-2.0. I mean, shouldn't it be illegal of phone vendors to flash a closed-source version of Android on their phones?

Edit: unironically I posted this before I went to bed and had a dream last night about giving a presentation on school about Linux. As you could guess, I wasn't able to tell whether phones use Linux or not.","As you said, Android uses the Linux kernel, which is licensed under the GPL.  This means that anyone who distributes Android builds must also provide you with the kernel source upon request.  They are free, however, to provide whatever userspace applications they'd like on top of that -- the license of the kernel does not affect the licensing of applications."

Edit : I have one external dependencies rest all are included in python only.","Haha... welcome to packaging hell :D

I'm not an expert, but, in a nutshell:

\- If you chose to do it from scratch, the ""unix way"", you'd have to target a specific distro and include a list dependencies in some sort of config file to create a .deb or .rpm file. If you have tons of dependencies, you'd probably have to maintain your own repo as well.

\- You could do it the ""windows way"", put your program + its dependencies + python in one folder (with Python, you can use tools like venv to do it automatically)  and use a tool like makeself, or a custom script to act as an installer.

\- The easiest way, though, in your scenario, is to use pyinstaller:

Why does the Linux mouse feel different than Windows and MacOS?,"I use Windows and Linux CLI for work/hobby purposes, and MacOS in the private.

Not bashing any OS, I like them all. There is just one thing that keeps me from going all Linux on a primary computer - the mouse pointer.

I am so used to the Windows and MacOS ""feel"" when using the mouse. The way it moves, accelerates, etc.

Whenever I give e.g. Kubuntu a try, I always get a ""different vibe"" using the pointer with the same mouse or touchpad as on the other OSes.

I've tried guides to match acceleration and stuff, but I just can't get it right.

Anyone know what I'm talking about? Any tips on how to get the same feel on Kubuntu (running on a Macbook Pro with touchpad) as with the MacOS?

What's the deal with Slackware?,"I know they are one of the oldest distros out there and it managed to stay relevent even today; but who the heck uses it? there are no popular spinoffs for it in my opinion. Is slackware specialized for something, making it niche? help me understand why this OS never seems to be mentioned!","Slackware is among my all-time favorite distros, the other being Debian.  It was up-to-date and a pleasure to use, but the head maintainer also had two other maintainers helping him at one time.  After they left the project, the project slowed down for reasons outside the head maintainer's control, and since then other distros have taken over.

When Slackware was popular, modern package managers were still in their infancy, and it was still not unusual to install directly from source to `/usr/local`.  Slack's package manager was very basic, not unlike some of its Unix contemporaries (proprietary Unixes were still in widespread use at the time and GNU/Linux wasn't taken very seriously yet).

Plus the amount of software at the time was still manageable, Linux hadn't exploded into its own version of DLL hell quite yet, and sysadmin wasn't quite the horrible chore it is today.

It was a simpler *nix for a simpler time, when Linux still had underground street cred."

You should contact the FSF or try to find information on what your donation will go toward, because it was difficult for me to narrow down what exactly it is that they *do*. Although they never responded to my email after a month.

[Here's a decent place to start.](https://www.fsf.org/about/)

Their greatest contributions appear to be hosting free software projects via Savannah and their mailing lists, sponsorship of the GNU Project, and help to ensure that software distributors comply with the GPL. However, it is very unclear whether any of your contributions will go toward GPL compliance, as they say they [""rely on pro-bono counsel to help come to an agreement.""](https://www.fsf.org/licensing/compliance)

These projects (gcc, glibc, coreutils, GRUB, etc.) generally have a good number of maintainers/developer interest, though I don't know the specifics. GNU/Linux is more than GNU or Linux. It's also the userland applications like GIMP, Krita, Blender, Lutris, OBS Studio, Cinelerra-GG.

The projects that would really benefit from funding are the smaller ones. Like [ZeMarmot](https://www.patreon.com/zemarmot/posts), currently the principle maintainers of GIMP (of which there is only a small development team) or [Øyvind Kolås

[Blender is well-funded and backed by several mega-corporations](https://fund.blender.org/), including Intel, NVIDIA, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook, but not so much that they couldn't benefit from your individual contribution.

Maybe you're in need of a DAW—Ardour is free software, but that doesn't mean it's free of charge. [You can buy Ardour and receive both the source code and a binary for your operating system, while supporting further development of the application.](https://community.ardour.org/download) You can pay what you want, though if you pay less than $45USD, you won't receive major upgrades (e.g. 6.9>7.0) but you will receive minor updates (e.g. 6.1>6.2>6.3>etc.).

Do you really like playing games on GNU/Linux? Even through WINE? [Lutris is a great application library/launcher/manager, and you can help fund further features such as cloud saves.](https://www.patreon.com/lutris)

[You can help out WINE](https://www.winehq.org/donate), whose donations are managed by Software Freedom Conservancy.

Syncthing is a lot easier to setup, though, and you get two way sync with no extra configuration. I reckon it would be easier to make a mess with Rsync than it would with Syncthing. 

One thing I like about Syncthing that I'd struggle to get right with other tools would be file locking on Libreoffice. With Syncthing, if one of my colleagues is editing a document in Libreoffice, I can only open a read-only version. If I used some other software that doesn't make lock files, Syncthing makes a sync-conflict file in the same directory. You could do that with rsync, but not trivially.

Of course, if they're plain text files, this is what version control is designed for. Sparkleshare is a good, if a little dated.

What really are the major differences between the Red Hat and Debian family trees?,"I've been using various linux distros for a few years now, and am pretty familiar with rhel/fedora types as well as ubuntu and derivatives.

Bonus question: Why is a package manager tied to a desktop? Why is fedora not able to use apt?","> Why is fedora not able to use apt?

There are no technical reasons. Fedora _could_ throw away all the DNF features, infrastructure and tooling developed over the last twenty-odd years and switch to Apt features, infrastructure and tooling. Heck, they could even rejuvenate Apt4rpm and do all the development needed to bring in all the features we want from a modern package manager.

But why would they? That's a whole lot of time and effort for the distribution's maintainers, and a lot of bother for end-users, to end up with something utterly equivalent in functionality.

Don't underestimate the momentum of existing solutions. DNF works quite well for Fedora users, and its success there means it's also a good target for new features. Similarly, Apt works quite well for Debian users. These are virtuous cycles."
How unsafe is it to ignore kernel updates?,"I'm using Fedora 32 and I recently installed the latest kernel available (5.6.19) and it borked my display setup (it doesn't show any refresh rate available and all the different resolutions I had disappeared -might be something related to drivers-). 5.6.18 works fine, so I boot into it.

I want to boot directly into 5.6.18 and ignore future updates because I don't feel like running the risk of ruining my setup again and fighting for hours to fix it.

So, is it too dangerous to ignore future kernel updates (unless there's some critical security fix)?

Edit: I mistyped the kernel version.","There should be few or no kernel updates that do not close security vulnerabilities. Therefore you must decide for yourself if the security updates affect your installations.

If I were you I would report the problem to the developers of your distribution (https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bugzilla) so they can fix it as soon as possible."
question about professional uses of desktop Linux on workstations,"In which non-IT fields is use of Linux workstations common? I know that workstation Linux is often used in software development, that’s why I’m asking about non-IT fields instead.

By workstation, I mean a high-power desktop PC that runs demanding applications (e.g., applications for video editing, simulation, content creation, engineering, etc.).  With this question, I’m NOT trying to find out about which organizations or professions use Linux to run office suite software on commodity PCs (I came across plenty of that info already when researching this question.)  I’m also not asking about professional uses of Linux where it’s run on the cloud or server, as opposed to on the desktop.  

By common use, I mean that at least 20% of a given field runs its specialized desktop software on Linux.  

One more question:  in professions/fields that commonly use desktop Linux workstations, is Ubuntu commonly the distro employed, or is that market more owned by RHEL and OpenSUSE?   I’m asking about Ubuntu’s share of professional use of high-power Linux workstations; I’m not asking about Ubuntu’s share of the overall desktop Linux market (which would include commodity PCs).  Thanks for any info you can provide!","I'm not a particularly good source for this but I heard 3D animation studios (Pixar, Dreamworks etc.) have been exclusively using Linux on their workstations for ages."
"Interested in moving to Linux, but have a few questions","Seen a lot of videos that has convinced me to make the move, especially now where the gap is extremely close. Another reason I'm moving to Linux is because I want to delve into coding and I think putting myself in an environment where that 'might' be necessary could help me out. Because of the pandemic, I have much extra time and I just can't let this opportunity pass up.

I do have the usual ""What distribution should I use?"" question. I have a particular set of needs that is difficult to narrow down. I do a lot of gaming and most of it is via Steam, though there are interesting games popping out in EGS so that might be something I should consider. It's easy to Google people recommending which distributions to use when it comes to gaming.

However, my additional issue is that I work as the sole Mech Engr in my workplace and sideline as a designer. Because of this, I receive a lot of files, letters, and the like sometimes as MSWord and MSExcel. I currently use Libre Office at home and that sometimes breaks the formatting of said files - I'm hoping there's an alt in Linux or a certain distro that could help with that.

My bigger problem though is for the design. Almost everyone uses AutoCAD, and sadly I have no license of my own to be able to use it (I live in Philippines, and even though no one could afford it here with our income, everyone pirates it, sadly). I have to ensure my files can be read by the Architect without issue so that he could include my design in the overall submission. Before I make the switch, I want to ensure that there's something out that works for Linux and could produce drawings that is almost fully compatible with AutoCAD. I can't stress this enough, I want to ensure there is very little compromise for this.

There's also other programs I use like stress and fluids sims, and similar. But those are usually for learning and not necessarily for work, so I don't mind making much more compromises for those.

Hoping people could help me out. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: I guess I should also clarify that I'm not entirely sure what separates most distros from others. I.e. will gaming-focused distros work well only with games but are horrible with CAD software, are there certain applications that work much better on some distros compared to others, etc.

In my particular case, I'm not sure if a distro with good Steam support might have compromises in other stuff like its support for spreadsheet and CAD software. Do these compromises even existent, or is the groundwork for most distros so well polished now that it's alright to assume that all of them could also support the mentioned software with little to no issue, etc.

\---------------------------------

UPDATE:

Thank you everyone for entertaining my queries! I'm glad I approached this community first, considering how open and honest you all are.

I've read most of the comments here, and it seems that though a great ton of you have recommended some distros, there is a vocal majority that say it's better to dual boot, and a few saying to stick to Windows with a Linux VM. I kind of wanted to just stick to Linux so that, if ever something irritates me, I couldn't easily go back to the ""safe space"" that is Windows. However, with how much people are recommending dual boot, it kind of gave me the feeling that having a way to access Windows is a necessity. 

To be honest, I really just wanted to learn how to do some programming and thought moving to Linux might help with that and put me in an environment to 'force' me to learn, so to speak - apart from the fact that there are a lot of ""to Linux and never came back"" stories around the net so the other side must certainly have greener pastures, right? Now I kind of feel like I'm not giving Linux the treatment it deserves.

I've decided to stick with Windows for now and hone my craft there, while also learn more complex programming there too. Once I get better, maybe I'll use a Linux VM. Most likely, I'll only decide to fully move to Linux once the gap between it and the two OS giants are extremely close, which I think will only be a matter of time. 

Again, I thank everyone! I apologize if it seemed like I'm misusing Linux from it's real purpose.","I'm surprised no one mentioned this, but there's an online version of the Microsoft Office Suite! You can literally use Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc. from a Linux machine, because there's a webapp version!

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/free-office-online-for-the-web

It even says it's free. I assume you need a legit Windows and/or Office key, but you do, so that's no problem. Disclaimer: I have personally not used this, so I can't vouch for it at all, I just know of it because of this great Youtuber, ExplainingComputers, who I strongly suggest you check out -- he's a lifelong Windows user who has decided to make the switch to Linux after the end of Windows 7, yet needs Windows for work reasons. I think you'll find his perspective relatable and useful \^_\^

I don't feel anyone has really answered ""what's the difference between distros"" very well, so I'll try my hand.

So, technically, Linux is not an operating system. Linux is a kernel that people build other software on top of. Android phones use the Linux kernel, for instance. So do most web servers and supercomputers.

Basically, a distro is just a collection of software that runs on the Linux kernel, that's hand-selected by the distro's maintainers (usually a group of nerds, but sometimes a company) to fashion an operating system out of.

You can literally download almost any distro, and by installing certain software and uninstalling or reconfiguring others, make it identical to any other distro. I say ""almost"" because there ARE some closed-source programs in Linux that certain distros use, but it's mostly open.

The REAL difference between distros, the MEANINGFUL difference, is 1) the release cycle and 2) the community.

As for release cycle, some distros push out updates to software the moment they're available. This means you're always on the cutting edge, but you could also wreck your system. Other distros have a much more infrequent updates and are much more stable, because they hold back on updates until major version updates of software prove themselves stable and reliable on a majority of machines.

As for the community, that's an equally important concern. A distro with a small, inactive community would be awful, no matter how technically well put-together the distro itself is, because any time you'd have trouble or questions, there'd be no one around to help, and problems would go unresolved for long periods of time.

Also, different communities have very different attitudes and userbases. Some are more filled with casual users, some more with gamers, some with power users, some with very philosophical folk who reject all non-open-source software, some with security afficionados. You'll find all types everywhere, but there's definite trends.

Now, you mentioned you'd potentially like a distro that forces you to learn. I'd say, check out Arch Linux. Not necessarily to use permanently, but definitely to try out. Arch Linux is basically a ""build your own Linux operating system toolkit"" -- when installed, it's just basic file commands and a method of connecting to the internet and downloading packages. You have to choose and install everything yourself, and the Arch Linux wiki is a fantastic source of information that explains it all in great detail. Indeed, most users of other distros rely on the Arch wiki.

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide

Now, you don't have to end up permanently using the machine you build, but you WILL learn a TON about how Linux works along the way, and will be much better equipped to understand other distros thereafter, so you can make an informed choice on your own.

One last thing I'll say, since this is already an overlong comment, is that depending on your hardware setup, you may want to look into doing hardware passthrough via VirtualBox and run Windows in a virtual machine on your new Linux machine. I haven't personally used AutoCAD, but people get modern high-end gaming running at 99.9% in a virtual machine by doing hardware passthrough, so I'd imagine there'd at least be a decent chance of AutoCAD performing well.

Hope I helped!"
What is the best way to get drivers for hardware in Linux?,"Hi, I am currently having problems with my laptop because my PCI SD card reader (AU6625 with driver alcor\_pci)does not work with linux.

I have had a go at creating drivers by myself (by adapting an existing driver) which worked. Because it worked I submitted a patch to the kernel. This patch came with 5.7, but to my dismay the SD card reader still isn't working. I even backported my patch to the kernel I originally tested it on and it still didn't work (which is really confusing).

So anyway, I have come to the conclusion that kernel development is not for me. Is there any way I can still get a working driver for my device? Is there somewhere I can send the reader so they will develop one for me? How much would that cost?

Thanks in advance for any help","Isn't Greg Kroah-Hartman still the driver czar?

He'd probably know who best to send hardware to."
"Linux vm hacked, help needed.","So this is a ubuntu server 18.10 running under esxi. The VM runs ipsec VPN with NordVPN, qBittorrent and connects to a cifs share. Nothing else runs on it so i just use password auth over ssh. No UFW or anything as I thought router firewall should be enough?


Recently connected with ssh to update any packages and noticed when I pushed up in the terminal there was some commands I had never used there before. Noticed it copying a python script from /tmp folder and setting up a systemd service for it.


I instantly shut it down and remove the network device before spinning it back up.

I check history and find [this.](https://pastebin.com/raw/bsAgm8tY)

I check auth.log and find [this.](https://pastebin.com/raw/buWKFshi)

I check syslog and find [this.](https://pastebin.com/raw/HbcKJz0G)

Then i take a look at his python script that he edited the systemd file for. [Script](https://pastebin.com/raw/FdFN1X5w)

I did run a scan on my wan-ip and this was the result:

    80/tcp   open     http
    443/tcp  open     https
    500/tcp  filtered isakmp
    6881/tcp filtered bittorrent-tracker    

Port 500 linked to the VM while 6881 linked to an IP not in use on the network.

Any ideas on how he got access? And what could the purpose of this be?

English is not my native language, so sorry for any error in my ways.



Edit:

So far i have done these changes

* Deleted the machine and made a new one
* Made sure all vm's rejects all but RSA
* Disabled root over ssh
* Enabled UFW on all vm's
* Only allow access to port 22 from my local subnet
* Removed port 500 and 6881 from router firewall. Only 80/443 is exposed now.

Next up will be generating new passwords on everything.

And here is a bit more info on what the setup is:

Storage VM - Debian - MergerFS and snapraid

Webserver VM - Ubuntu - Reverse proxy - Exposed 80/443 

qBittorrent VM - Ubuntu - For downloading with VPN over IKEv2 

LXD Host VM - Ubuntu - Hosts about 15 containers - One of these hosts organizr that is my landing page. All apps used in reversed proxy is locked down with auth block that requires my login in organizr. None of these containers allow ssh access.

Thanks for all the help so far!","I would offline the VM immediately, mark it's volume read only, create a new VM with a fresh 18.10 install, make sure the new VM is up to date, attach the read only volume, and do my forensics from there.  When you are done investigating, delete both VMs.

You don't want that machine to stay up with a foothold on your network."
"Have companies like RedHat, Amazon, Google, Apple, etc. been a force for good or bad for Linux?",I'm not trying to create a **heated** debate with this post. I'm genuinely interested in people's viewpoints on this. I'm in the process of creating a documentary about open-source software and this is a question that came to mind.,"I would separate Red Hat from those other companies.

Red Hat has, since its founding, hired and paid a lot of Open Source developers (including Alan Cox, who was employed there for some time) and pushed the adoption of Linux outside the “hobbyist” into the enterprise. Linux wouldn't be where it is now without Red Hat. (Although it lost its way since IBM takeover...)

Apple (and Google) took khtml and never committed back. Apple took BSD, but didn't touch a lot of GPL code...

Especially Amazon (but also other SaaS companies) have just exploited the GPL gap that you only need to provide your code if you distribute the binary. This doesn't apply to SaaS usage, so they took the code, and any improvements were rarely committed back.

Google is a bit in the middle, they have done some fantastic work they brought back to Linux / Open Source, but also keep some stuff for their own, also just Gold members of the Linux foundation? Thats the same level as Honda or Sony...

Notably, the hardware manufacturers like Intel and AMD did commit a lot of code.

PS: to be open about it, I was a Red Hat employee in the 2000s"
LibreOffice or Onlyoffice?,"Need just a proper office software to do my tasks... Well I don't work with Windows users or any domain so I don't really have to look for compactiblity issues but I want to know what office suite would be great for better editing, compiling and designing my files (Documents, Spreadsheets and Presentations) ... Don't recommend web based editors please I know them and thats just way too basic for me..","I prefer OnlyOffice over Libre. OpenOffice is much more like MS Office freshly installed, without having to tweak the layout. It’s just what I am use to. Both will do what you want. Install them both and have a look."
So what exactly do I do if Linux crashes?,"The standard thing to do on windows is Cntrl+shift+del, but that's got no use in Linux.

Sometimes (very rarely) my plasma she'll just freezes and I'd be left with no method to restart it. I could cntrl alt t and use xkill to kill off a window if it's just an app that's hanging, but what do I do if my entire DE crashes? 

I assume the most logical thing to do is opening up a new tty and starting a new session, but I don't know how to do this. 

What can be done when Linux freezes?","You can go into console mode by pressing ctrl+alt+F3, where you can then restart the display manager, kill processes, reboot the computer or anything else you'd do from a terminal. You used to be able to use ctrl+alt+backspace to kill the X server, but I think that's been disabled by default for quite some time now. Ctrl+alt+delete should also trigger a reboot."
How to wipe all user data on every restart?,"I am a airbnb host and i would like to put a mini pc under the tv set.   
I dont want any data from previous guests staying on the device.   


I would like to say to the guests - if you work on something dont turn off or restart the computer, or you will loose ALL your data",Put /home partition on a ramdisk.
why dont programs need to support different filesystems?,"I'm always hearing about ""this program needs to add support for wayland/pipewire/gtk4/whatever"", but I have never heard of a program needing to add support for a filesystem. It kind of just works regardless of the file system you have installed. Why is that?","Because the application doesn't know or care which filesystem you're using - all it knows is it needs to read from or write to a file.  The actual coordination between the file request and the filesystem is handled by the kernel.  The application doesn't need to know  :)

Then I checked cinnamon-settings and apparently my headphones were turned to 5928%.

Windows Update deleted(?) GRUB from my computer,"This is half vent, half cry for help, so bare with me. Also not exactly a Linux question? but probably close enough.

I had to boot into windows (for uni software) which then promptly decided to blue screen me in order to force me to run an update, I begrudgingly complied, since I couldn't really do much at this point

Letting my computer do its thing after a while I noticed that my bios was updating as well, but I said whatever and I paid no mind.

Fast forward to now, I come home from uni and boot my computer only to find that it boots straight to windows. Thinking the update probably just changed my default boot manager, I go into the bios settings only to find that GRUB is completely missing as a boot manager option

So I think the ""accidental"" mandatory update just straight up deleted GRUB from my computer, or at least I'm pretty sure that happened

If anyone else has had this happen to them I'd appreciate some feedback, besides that I'll probably try booting from USB to reinstall GRUB, but man do I hate windows right now

update: I did not need to boot from iso, I used windows secure boot and booted Linux from there. running grub-install and grub-mkconfig, then changing default boot manager from bios settings did the job. I'm glad it was an easy, albeit annoying fix.

After this whole ordeal I'm considering replacing dual booting with a VM, but anyways thanks",it happens if you inastall the bootloader in the same hd or ssd where you install windows. Windows just do that. It's a very reported things and that's why it's not advisable to install linux on the same hd. you can recover your grub by just booting with a live usb and reinstalling it.
What do you think are some exciting upcoming techs coming on linux?,"I see some efforts to create some new distros here and there like MicroOS and silverblue. But there are much more out there. Guix is something that looks interesting. But my question is what do you foresee or what would you like to see from some distro in the future? Any tech innovation, feature or ability? i think you get it","1. Wayland + Pipewire moving into the mainstream
2. Modern CoW snapshotting filesystems (BTRFS, ZFS) being more of a thing (Fedora & OpenSUSE default to BTRFS and OpenSUSE has the great snapper tool integrated into the distro, Ubuntu has been making good progress on ZFS, encrypted ZFS, and a tool for making the most of snapshots, BTRFS + Timeshfit is also popular among Arch users.
3. Flatpak, specifically the development/implementation of its sandboxing capabilities, refinements to its integration with the system and system theme etc, and hopefully more and more developers officially publishing to flatpak. Here is a good [counterpoint](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/u2v8bq/comment/i4ldmoq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to my excitement about flatpak though.
4. Gnome and KDE are steadily improving and being refined. Gnome in particular has been making some big-ish positive steps lately I think, and I'm excited to see where that leads. KDE has been making more incremental/steady, but still positive progress.
5. Immutable distros like Fedora Silverblue, not sure its my cup of tea, and some of it goes over my head, but I understand (some of) the appeal, and am excited to see the progress.
6. Face tagging / facial recognition (this seems to be perpetually a pre-alpha thing in Linux). I really like my personal photo library to be organizable by 'people' / automatically group by face. But I don't trust this sensitive data to cloud services, or big tech (advertising/tracking companies) like Google, etc. If this could be done locally, on device, this would make me happy. digikam and shotwell have been on the edge of implementing these features for years but never seem to get there. Deepin apparently, has made some progress here, I haven't looked into it, but hope it may be picked up by other projects."
What is the appeal of Gentoo?,"I'm fairly new to Linux although I have been using it for a few years now but only recently decided to fully switch from Windows. I watch Mental Outlaw's videos on YouTube and I find them very informative and even entertaining. I was wondering given it's complexity, what exactly is the appeal of Gentoo over say Debian or Manjaro? As I understand, Gentoo is completely compiled from source, and all its packages need to be manually compiled by the user. I was hoping to hear from some Gentoo users about their experience and also what they like about it. I'm also looking to be educated about the subject. Thank you!","I'm not using Gentoo right now, but I used it for several years (years ago, so my impressions might be out of date). I'd say Gentoo is an enthusiast/technical user sort of distro. If you just want to do stuff, I'd say you'd be better off with something else. That said, it has upsides:

* You can squeeze out more performance by compiling specifically to your computer's CPU. This doesn't matter much to most people, but could be a benefit if you want to get the most of low power hardware, or do some sort of very intense processing where a gain of 10% would be noticeable.
* You get more ability to use new and experimental compiler technologies. 
* You get a lot more ability to decide exactly what you're going to build support for. Besides the performance reasons this is sometimes helpful if some piece of functionality you can do without proves troublesome. 
* You're interested in something right at the bleeding edge. Gentoo makes it quite easy to try the very latest code, or to apply patches to system software.
* It's somewhat more convenient to build stuff on, since all the tools and dependencies will already be installed. So if you want to try some new program that isn't packaged yet anywhere, it can be easier to make it build on something like Gentoo.

My personal take: Use it if you think it sounds like something cool to mess around with, or if you have an actual use case like the above. Don't use it for anything critical, or anything you wouldn't want to see in an unusable state for a few hours/days.

Also, Gentoo has a package manager. You don't compile stuff by hand, the package manager compiles everything for you. It's just that installing anything involves the package manager downloading and compiling source."
Why doesn't linux have something like Windows's Troubleshooter?,"Not saying it needs it or anything, just curious as of if there is any specific reasons.

How bad is it to not have a swap portion?,So I made an bootable ssd with pop_os 20.04 but i did not make a swap portion what problemls can this cause?,"You should make a swap file then using fallocate.

EDIT: as several folks have pointed out, don't use fallocate from older versions of util-linux and modern file systems. It's probably ok with most file systems with util-linux 2.36 but when in doubt `dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/swapfile BS=1M count=SIZE_OF_SWAP_IN_MEGS` is your ticket.

Buying A Used Laptop For Linux?,"Hi, all.

I'm planning to get a slightly aged laptop to install Linux Mint on it, so I can experiment with it first before switching to it as my primary OS. I'm not much of a gamer now like I was years ago so I won't worry about playing games on it.

I'll use it primarily for experimentation, basic word processing, probably recording music and video editing via open-sourced software. So think of this as using Linux as an everyday OS on a casual level.

"Can open source creative software REALLY compete with the proprietary industry standards (Adobe PS, Lightroom, etc?)","I have an active artist friend swears he can do anything and everything in GIMP and other open source applications. On the contrary, I've heard a couple of other professional artists who said they gave the open source alternatives (mostly GIMP) an honest try and that they simply do not serve all their needs and could never compete beyond amateur work.

I'm looking for unbiased opinions here. Recently I heard a Linux youtuber admit that video editing in Linux is incredibly limited, however, some pro grade apps like DaVinci resolve are now supported on linux.","In my opinion, it's less about the actual capabilities at this point than it is about the user's willingness to (in some instances) fundamentally alter their workflow.  Applications like GIMP, Inkscape have come a *very* long way and are (again, in my opinion) quite capable of professional-level work.

Regarding video editing, again, it's more a matter of workflow.  Kdenlive & Blender (while it's not Blender's primary purpose) are both very capable of doing these things."

So, when I was on Arch, installing stuff from github wasn't a great deal as more or less every project was in AUR and I just needed yay to do the heavy lifting for me, I hadn't installed flatpak, snap or any software center, because almost everything was in the AUR.

Now, I've switched to Fedora and I realize how difficult ( for me) it is to compile each program, I mean, I have to first install that specific programming language, such as go rust etc.. then install the tools like C Development Tools Group on Fedora, then the dependencies only to find that one dependency has updated itself with a new name or isn't available in Fedora 39...

I mean, I know, Linux is built on libre software philosophy, and having source code means you can modify stuff if you want to, but it is quite tedious to compile every stuff I have to use.... So what's the problem with providing pre-built binaries for different architectures? 

Gosh, I really miss AUR and yay.","Binaries are available for all distros, especially the big distros. It is extremely unlikely that you got binaries for Arch but not for Fedora.

Compiling programs is useful is many scenarios: your distro is out of date and its corresponding online software repository is no longer available, or you have unusual hardware or OS, or you want to install a niche program that hasn't been packaged for all distros, or you want the latest development snapshot.

Compiling is very easy if they mention the prerequisites. Anyway, it is a one-time process that doesn't need to be repeated."
Is there a way to set up a computer to delete all files after logging off?,I am setting up a communal computer that I don't want people to save files on. The idea is that you login check your email or download your boarding pass to print it. When you log out the files you downloaded are deleted and the next person to login gets a fresh setup.,"If you want to work it out yourself, you can actually create script which deletes all files in home directory including config folders at logout.
But some distros provide guest user (example linux mint), in linux mint you go to ""login screen"" application (which is a actually settings for the login window) and enable the guest user there. So when your computer boots, you would see the regular user and also the guest user and login in any. So people accessing the computer can just click on guest and use it"
Why are Intel network cards best supported in Linux?,I've heard Intel network cards are the least likely to cause problems in Linux or BSD. Is it because Intel actively tries to make good Linux drivers? Does Intel open source its drivers or make the documentation needed for good drivers readily available? What makes Intel different from other network card chipset manufacturers?,"intel has their networking (and video for that matter) drivers in the kernel, as such they are opensource, and they have a long track record of having driver support in place long before the corresponding hardware hits the market."

Help me find a distro based on a childhood memory 😊,"Hi everyone! First off, I know this question might sound stupid but I would really like to find this out if possible. So I remember this one time I was at my friend's house in the early 2000s (I was still a kid) and I remember seeing that they had Linux installed on their computer. For years I've been trying to figure out what exact OS this is. All I can remember is a cute shutdown animation of Tux together with a light switch. I also remember tux image changing after what you chose? (He slept if you chose sleep) My memory is not working that well, but it in a way resembled Windows XP a bit (maybe) 
I know it's a silly question and a really hard one based on little information I have, but does anyone have an idea what this distro could be?","The desktop environment could've been KDE 3, you can use Trinity Desktop Environment (A continuation of KDE 3)s Ubuntu live ISOs to see if that has it"
Applications written solely in Assembly,I could only find e3 text editor so far. Do you know of any others?,"Probably worth mentioning Spinrite here. 

It's a hard drive data recovery program, that is written entirely in Assembly, carefully by hand. 

Although, technically it's operating system is ""Free DOS"". So it can self boot into it's own mini-OS, on any PC type machine (Windows, Linux, Apple).

It can then scan/recover volumes and drives running under those operating systems. 

Author Steve Gibson (he's a pretty awesome and interesting guy) insists on coding it in Assembly language to make it as small and efficient as possible, with really low level access/communications with hard drive controllers. 

Another reason he uses Assembly language to write his stuff is simply... because he's old fashioned and likes it, and that's what he first learnt in the 60's/70's! (He started off by making vision-camera systems back then using Assembly language.)  

Also, he's been working parttime on the latest, Spinrite 7 since a few years ago, which will be a huge revision, and again designed to work with a huge variety of hard-drive and SSD controllers, and formats. So working with all those chipsets is no easy undertaking. 

But ya, I'm guessing the new Spinrite 7 should be released pretty soon now... Haven't checked in on it in a while."
"Why doesn't everyone use appimages instead of .deb, .rpm or other native binary system?","Question's in the title

EDIT : I personally, rarely use appimages because all the packages that I need are already available in AUR and Pacman repos but I wanted to hear about your opinions on this one as appimages are quite a advantage for developers as they only have to create the binaries once.This is also what I think Linus(Torvalds) was talking about in one of his talks that linux is quite spread out and that many devs don't make binaries for linux because of the binary hassle.He was also comparing it to how devs make bins for macos and windows, but not linux.

Also, if appimages are modified in a way that makes them upgradable and also make it so that it can be downloaded from a package manager, would you use it?  

And, what do you think would happen to the linux community if all distros started using this package manager?","- manual search and download of applications vs just searching and using you native packagemanager
- update capabilities depend on appimage provider, only the minority even provides them and if then updating can depend of several different update tools and loading updates from several different locations
- larger disk space requirements
- Lack of trust in appimage provider to supply updates as soon as one of the dependency they use has a security issue (not just the ""primary"" program they want to distribute). With distro packages this is much less of a concern because maintainer only must keep up with their packages, not with every dependency they use (the maintainer of that dependency must)
- doesn't work on every distro (for example most appimages will only work on gnu glibc distros)

Probably forgot some points. And don't take this as me disliking appimages...they are a nice way of distributing software but they will never replace distro package managers for the mentioned reasons."
Save the current state of my distro to an ISO,"TLDR: Is there a way I can configure a distro to my liking (with software and themes) and make an ISO out of it, so that when I install it on another machine it has all the themes applied and software installed?

Hello, I switched from Windows to Ubuntu about 4 months ago since I already knew my way around the terminal as I work with linux servers and all the software I needed was available. After spending this time with it I decided I wanted to switch distros and after experimenting a bit Manjaro KDE was the winner.

Since I work and don't really have a lot of time to spend on setting things up my idea was to do it on a VM in my free time and when its ready, make an ISO and install it on my main PC and laptop, that way I already have everything setup to my liking. Is this possible by any chance?

Thank you in advance.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I have accomplished what I wanted using Clonezilla like a lot of people recommended me to. I followed [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/iiobx1/convert_virtual_machine_to_physical_image_iso_file/g38yifp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that u/kalzEOS provided and although it worked, I had 2 issues.

First problem: After restoring the OS to my main PC, I had to resize my partition. The VM had 40GB of space and my PC had a 500GB SSD so it created a 40GB partition and left the rest unpartitioned. To solve this, I simply expanded the 40GB to 500GB using a tool called GParted.

Second problem: This one was driver related. The video drivers installed on the OS were VMWare drivers. What I had to do was uninstall these and install the NVIDIA ones (I have a GXT950). After installing these drivers and rebooting, I ran into a problem (which I don't really think related to Clonezilla or the installation process) where some apps and the text were huge. To fix this, I had to force a DPI in the nvidia config file. To do this, open the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-nvidia.conf and   look for a line where it says ' Section ""Device"" ', then right before the 'EndSection' add 'Option ""DPI"" ""96 x 96"" '. After saving and rebooting, everything went back to normal.

Why does Discord's screen sharing tank performance so much on Linux?,"If I screenshare on Windows it works pretty well and I can keep playing most games at a stable framerate even if it goes down a little.

On Linux however, most games (even older ones) struggle massively. I don't have a wimpy PC either (6700k @ 4.5 + GTX1070 + 40GB of ram + Liquorix kernel, Kubuntu 20.04). The main symptom is not that the average FPS takes an unplayable hit, but that it causes a load of high frequency micro-freezing which makes the games feel unplayable. And in some games it even causes audio to bug out and robot-ify because of the performance loss.

If I open htop in a terminal on my second screen, I can see that usually xorg is running at maybe 50% CPU so maybe that's the cause (or part of it), but that isn't a full CPU core if I understand htop's default way of measuring CPU load. My CPU is never at 100% on any core when screen sharing so it just confuses me further.

Doesn't help that discord still sees both my screens as one display, even now that it claims to see both individually. But even in window share this problem persists.

Is this a shared experience? Is it Xorg's fault? (can wayland users use discord screenshare?)","Well, it's an Electron app that doesn't Support Hardware Acceleration on Linux, afaik

Something's eating almost 30GiB of my free disk space,"According to `df` my home partition is 598G with 567G used. This should leave me with 31G of free space, but `df` reports only 2,1G available.

"ELI5 why Snaps are so bad (hard numbers please!) and how Flatpaks, AppImages or Package Managers are better","I've just been seeing a lot of hate lately about these various forms of software distribution, and I'm honestly quite confused. 

&#x200B;

So, I'm a Linux user. I'm writing this on the latest Ubuntu. I run Manjaro on my laptop. I generally install Linux Distros on a whole bunch of things. **I often end up using many of these packaging solutions.** And I realize the advantages they can bring, I just can't seem to figure out where all of the complaints are coming from and exactly how these systems work.

&#x200B;

**Is there any real, evident reason not to use snaps?** What I mean is, there's plenty of people talking about how the Snap backend and all of its server-side functions are entirely dependant on Canonical, and how it's up to them to pick who gets to be on the store. But I've never actually seen any drama or complaints about Canonical not cooperating with developers or violating the user's privacy. If you have, could you please point me to a few of your sources? I'm honestly interested in reading up about these things, and every crappy YouTube video going over the same bullet points isn't helping out. Yes, I understand Canonical has had a shaky history with keeping projects alive. But there's a lot of high profile developers providing their apps on the Snap Store, some of them even exclusively.

&#x200B;

**Is performance really worse with snaps?** I have been using a Minecraft snap and haven't really seen a difference. My 2FA manager, Authy, is exclusively available in the Snap Store, and that has been performing better than on Windows. But then, I hear so many users complaining about performance, especially on the first launch. Is that the case, and does anyone have any data pointing to that conclusion? Once again, I'd love to read up on the technicalities of the matter. But as a simple user, SquashFS sounds like a good way to reduce random reads, and thus improve performance.

&#x200B;

**Are Flatpaks (or AppImages for that matter) TECHNICALLY superior?** I understand that not being limited to the Flathub is Flatpak's big advantage, similar to how every package manager can have its own repositories. But, as a distribution format, is it actually better? Is the performance better? And, most importantly, is it easier to develop and support? Which one of these solutions is more likely to work out of the box, both for developers and end-users? I watched a presentation on some of the inner workings on Flatpaks, but it honestly went over my head. As an outsider, both Snaps and Flatpaks seem to have the same technical limitations, but I'd love to figure out the intricate differences between the two. And, lastly, how sustainable is their system moving forwards? Is it ready to take on even bigger projects and codebases that interact with even more parts of your system?

&#x200B;

**Finally, and most importantly, which one of these is easier to develop and publish for?** Coming from Manjaro and Arch back to Debian, it was clear that the single biggest advantage (and disadvantage) was the AUR. It succeeded because it was easy to use and open to everyone. Could these packaging methods be as easy to develop for as the AUR? Taking a look at the Snap website and the Snapcraft GitHub, it's clear to me that the team has spent a lot of their time on documenting the process of creating a Snap and making sure development is easy to get started and smooth to upkeep. I can't find similarly detailed information and starting points for the other two solutions. And none of these matches the simplicity of the AUR. But, if there was ever a chance that one of these solutions could become similar to the AUR, which one would it be? As a software developer, which one would you choose?

&#x200B;

If you read all of that, thank you so much. These are just my thoughts over the past few weeks, and **I would love to discuss this with you in the comments.** I'm not looking to start a war, just to find out which one works best for me and I should support moving forwards.","I don't know how many times it has been discussed on this sub.

My only complaint is proprietary app store. It gives too much power to Canonical. The way Canonical is pushing it in ubuntu, such as forcibly installing chromium's snap, even when apt is used, is already causing me concern towards their practices, if snap becomes the leading distribution method. They open source the store or do not make it hardcoded into snap, I am ready to ignore all the technical disadvantages they have to flatpaks and appimages"
Should I replace macOS with Ubuntu on my old MacBook Pro [complete Linux noob!],"My old Macbook Pro, for some reason lately, has been running like garbage... so slow and freezing up a lot. I can basically only use it for surfing the web and iTunes. So, I've been thinking of replace macOS with Ubuntu following [this guide](https://laptop.ninja/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-a-macbook-pro/).

Here are my Macbook specs:

* macOS: High Sierra, 10.13.6 (cannot update anymore)
* MacBook Pro (13-inch, Early 2011)
* Processor:  2.3 GHz Intel Core i5
* Memory:  4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3
* Graphics:  Intel HD Graphics 3000 384 MB

Before doing so, does anyone have pros and cons of making this move? I guess if it doesn't work out, I can always go back to macOS... Just looking for any input, comments or suggestions...

Thanks!

**EDIT**: Wow, this blew up.. thank you all for the comments, very much appreciated! Based on all your great feedback I'm going to stick with macOS - I'll update my SSD and RAM. 

Again - thank you all!!!","You would get better results by switching your MacBook drive to SSD and upgrading it to 8gb ram. It will feel much much faster overall.

Strange request: How to do a presentation about Linux,"I have a project to do and it's about our ""passions"". Well, I have a lot of activities, and I may be pretty good at them, but none of them really ignite a spark other than Linux and a certain jumping cube game. Video games are out of the question, so it's either something generic or Linux.

Now, it will take some time for my teacher to get his head around this ""activity"" that is done entirely on a computer, since that sounds like video games. How should I approach this?

I have a maximum of 4 slides for my presentation and I have to talk about my what Linux is, my personal experience, and how you can get involved.","1. Introduction (something in k.i.s.s. style)
2. What you like about Linux
3. Your experience (I suggest you to focus on what you liked most and why, but still, pay attention on the language, you don't want to be technical otherwise people will not like your presentation)
4. Questions?"
Going from Windows 10 to Linux questions,"I use an older laptop as my primary machine at home, generally for web surfing, email, and occasionally simple video editing. This laptop has the latest Windows 10 64bit on it, but the problem is that despite my best efforts there are all sorts of background internet things happening including downloading updates. This is despite the fact that I've turned off all such updating processes that I can find. The reason why this is a problem is because I get my internet through a smart phone and my data cap for the month is 10gb, after which my speeds get dropped to a wholly unusable 125kb. 

Since I can't fight Windows on this anymore, would some flavor of linux be appropriate? I figure all the basics would be available for linux like the GUI, various basic apps, and browsers. The main question would be the video editing, but I just use Windows Movie Maker for that, it's really simple. Basically, I don't want anything using any data at all unless I explicitly allow it to, and ideally it would be nice if I had some sort of accurate data use tracker so I could better manage my data cap. Currently if I am very frugal with my data usage I can usually get two, maybe three weeks into my month before hitting the cap.

The laptop has a Core i5 M 520 processor running at 2.4GHz with 4GB RAM.

Edit: My thoughts so far: Awesome info! I used to hang out with the local linux user's group back in the early 1990s, North Texas Linux User's Group, or NTLUG. I ended up not going with a linux install at the time, something I still think of as a mistake. I remember them being a fun and interesting bunch of people, for sure! I also remember that hardware compatibility was more of a problem back then, especially with laptops, but that no longer seems like the case. Whatever distro I choose I will get a friend of mine to download for me. Can the install run off an optical drive, or would USB be better or more efficient? He usually gets me stuff on a portable hard drive, though I can get him a 128GB thumbdrive to put things on.","If you wish, you can turn off Linux updates, or you can tell it to only install the safest ones and ignore the ""cutting-edge"" developers stuff. You can even schedule these to the end of the month but that's more advanced.

A popular distribution is Linux Mint, which is less than 2GB to download. It's a fairly recent version so there shouldn't be too many updates to catch up on.

This includes common apps such as LibreOffice, Firefox, VLC, GIMP and Thunderbird, but not a video editor. Try Openshot, which is another 200MB.

If you want to check on internet use, try something like vnStat, which is less than 300kB."
Finally made the switch (COMPLETELY),"The past few months, I have slowly learned Linux. And slowly I have switched all of my machines over to the good side. As of yesterday, I have finally turned my gaming rig into a Linux powerhouse. I was very hesitant and had to ween myself off completely.

Now my questions are; I have an extremely over clocked system, does Linux really care? I have a 9700k @ 5.2ghz and 3200 DD4 @ 3600. I mean do I REALLY need my system amped up that high? I know Linux runs way better on machines, if I don't need 5.2ghz then I'd rather try to save the life of my parts.

Why are Linux machines battery hungry?,"This is going to sound like an explainlikeimfive question, but after running Linux on an m1 Mac I noticed the battery life is pretty poor compared to macOS. Then after looking online, I notice that other users report worse battery life on x86 laptops too. I also wonder about how power draw is on desktop machines compared to windows workstations. Any users experience higher wattages on Linux? Is there any work being done to make things more efficient? I kinda feel like it should be a priority, now that our environment is what’s at stake here, or at the very least, our electric bill… thoughts?","The problem is that a lot of battery optimizations depend on proprietary firmware, which needs to be reverse engineered and cannot achieve the same efficiency as the first party software."
How exactly does terminal output work?,"You know when you're installing something using the terminal and the installer will output the progress bar to standard out and each progress update overwrites the last such that the progress bar looks like an animation all in one single line?

I'm curious about how that is possible. The way I always thought of standard out is that it is like printing text on a piece of paper. But obviously a printer cannot erase what it just printed and print another text on the same line.

This makes me think standard out is more like a file (that can be easily overwritten) and the terminal is just rendering that file for the user to see. 

How does this work?","[ansi escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code)

Those are ""special"" codes which a terminal emulator instead of printing them uses to do...""special"" stuff...like moving the cursor to another position.

For example `printf ""\033[2A""; printf ""hello World""` will first move the cursor up two lines then print ""hello world"". With those cursor move commands you can create a progress bar.

Of course nobody really wants to deal with creating output and manually adding ansi escape codes to it...so we have libraries like [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) that makes this all a lot easier."

Problems installing Linux on an ancient laptop,"I'm trying to repurpose a 10-year-old laptop (an Acer Aspire 5551) as a web-and-word machine until it finally packs in. The issue I'm hitting is that some of its hardware, notably the graphics chipset, is not supported by the newer Linux kernel.

The main issue I'm hitting with it is ""\[drm:radeon\_init\[radeon\]\] ERROR No UMS support in Radeon module! "" - As the chipset doesn't support the newer KMS standard. I can get into a live CD of Ubuntu 20.10 with some difficulty, but after installing it'll choke on boot and simply keep sleeping before I hit the login screen.

The 20.10 live CD also has issues with my networking devices, disabling the Ethernet by default and not recognising my wifi card.

So I'm faced with three options:

* Find out how to inject the appropriate drivers into the install while I'm in the Live CD and set the kernel to support the device
* Find an older supported version of Linux that will install and run.
   * I found an ISO of Ubuntu Studio 14.04 on my main PC which will boot, install and run with no issues. However, I understand that 14.04 is not supported any more and I'm a big supporter of ""no insecure operating systems on the network"". In that I know I could install Win 7  on this laptop, as that's what it came with, but I refuse to as it's going to be a magnet for viruses.
* Hope one of my Win 10 keys works and it's not too bloated for this old laptop, assuming that doesn't have similar problems with the hardware. As I'm posting here, this is obviously my last resort.

I'm looking for help with getting the newer version to play nice with older hardware or find out the oldest supported version of Ubuntu (or other Debian-based OS) that will run on this machine.

* Ubuntu Studio 14.04 - the one i just had lying around and tried just in case.

Haven't tried yet

* Open SUSE Leap 15.2

Not burned to DVD yet but planned

* Linux Mint Debian

Live CD wouldn't load without problems, likely needs bootloader options

* Ubuntu 20.10
* Lubuntu 16.04 and 18.04
* MX Linux 19.3
* Zorin OS 15.3 Lite
* Manjaro 20.2

As for boot loader options, u/Gutotito seemed to have the right idea there. While nomodeset did nothing to help me on its own, acpi=off allowed me into Ubuntu 20.10 without any issues. So I think I'm going to play with them on some of the lighter distros to see if I can get it to install, and then use them to try and boot to get some drivers installed.

EDIT 2:

So progress has been made in that it would appear Kernel 4.4 gives me the fewest problems.

I used Manjaro Architect to install each 4.x kernel and tried each. It's not perfect, it does have an issue where I'll have no network until it's gone to sleep at least once, but when woken up will establish connections and stop randomly falling asleep. I may play about more to fix that issue, but then this is just a stop-gap to make use of old hardware. Otherwise when it works Manjaro is nice and wizzy and seems to do what I need: have firefox (Youtube, Google Docs and Office 365 seem to run fast enough), LibreOffice, and GIMP. So I'm going to mark this solved and start a new post to fix this.
Thanks to all who upvoted.","You may want to give Linux Mint Debian Edition, antiX, and/or MX Linux a test spin. Especially the latter two, they share a mission of keeping old hardware functioning."
Is there a POSIX shell manual?,"The POSIX shell manual, `man sh`, is not extensive at all, it only explains some environmental variables and its vi mode editing commands.

When I check bash's manual, `man bash`, it is much more extensive, it explains its syntax, test tools, etc.

Is there a manual, or resource in general, for me to check the POSIX shell's syntax and functionalities? E.g. the differences between using `'...'` and `""...""`, how do `<(...)` blocks work, how do the different `${var:: ...}` expansions work, etc. Some of these are in the bash manual, but it makes it difficult to distinguish between bash and shell features.

I know that, for example, I can find the `[ -f ... ]` test expressions in `man test`. Does this mean that all these features are dispersed between other manual pages?

Thanks a lot in advance","The one and only official source of POSIX documentation is published by the Open Group (written in collab with IEEE and ISO):

The safest solution might be to move the dotfiles to ~/.config and create a corresponding symlink in the home directory (similar to [GNU Stow](https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow)).

Are there any Linux distros that tend to get bloated overtime like windows?,"To cut a long story short a week or two ago I installed Lubuntu on to my computer (which turns 9 this year!) And I was amazed at just how new It felt. My dad saw this and thought that he'd like to try and breathe life into the old family computer.

New, exciting opportunities are installed without your consent, because you would otherwise miss out on these wonderful new products and ideas.

I think people as a whole have very short term memories and completely forget the Microsoft Anti-Trust monopoly abuses.

In addition, people have already forgotten about the Ed Snowden leaks.  The Cambridge Analytica scandal has been reported by the major media just as that:  A problem with between one platform (Facebook) and one privacy abuser (Cambridge Analytica).  Nobody in the US wants to talk about this being a problem with nearly every company that has an online presence and collects and trades/sells data: Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Samsung, Facebook, Twitter, etc...

Few people care about the Intel Management Engine and similar AMD backdoors that allow government organizations like the NSA to remotely install software.  Nobody seems to be concerned that the NSA has tools that can remotely install software/spyware on computers.  We know this thanks to the WannaCry ransomware attack, where hackers stole and adapted the NSA tool EternalBlue.

Add in the fact that people are just really ignorant about the dangers of governments and other nefarious interests collecting massive hoards of data on their users and using AI to analyze metadata and with increasing accuracy and specificity to make predictions about people -- we have a problem.

The only way for this to improve is to make steps that the EU has done to protect user privacy -- in addition to educating people and making them aware of why privacy is important in the first place."

Linux seems not bad to me.,"I created a post that asks people why people don’t use Linux. But these problems aren’t a problem for me.

1. Playing games

Linux have steam, proton, wine and box64. So all of the games that I play can run on the pc. (Actually, I don’t play any game owned by EA or Epic games. Will you play a game owned or sold by a company whose customer service is not as good as another one?)

2. Working

I use libreoffice instead of Microsoft office.
If libreoffice’s feature isn’t enough to you, you can use google docs and other services.

3. Stability and privacy 

Nobody tracks you. And no annoying runtime broker anymore. It’s much healthier to my old computer.

Maybe I don’t use those features, so I haven’t get any problem. What do you think?","Long time Linux user, I'm gonna play devil's advocate here.


Playing games: a lot of people play games that use kernel level anti-cheat or DRM that is not compatible with Linux, even with all the compatibility layers you can think of. Gaming on Linux is obviously so much better than years ago, but for some people it's not gonna cut it because of that.


Working: sometimes you have no choice but to use some specific tools, especially when they are imposed to you by your company. Like if the rest of your colleagues use the Adobe suite, you'll have to use Adobe products to fit in the workflow. Same with MS Office if everything relies on Microsoft products. If your choice if software only involves you, go for alternatives, but otherwise well tough luck.


Stability and privacy: nothing to say on privacy. For stability tho it depends on the distro. And companies would rather have an OS backed by a big company that can provide support in case something goes wrong. I know there is Canonical and Red Hat who offer that kind of support, idk how well they compare against MS or Apple.


Conclusion, there is no absolute good or bad choice, only options that are well suited or not to your needs and you should choose accordingly."
Why are flatpaks considered evil?,"No, but seriously, what is a flatpak and why everyone thinks it's the inferior way to install programs?
I understand a flatpak is tbat you install from the software store of your distro, but I don't get why that would be bad ñ","There's nothing inherently evil. It's not designed to track you, steal your data, or orchestrate the doom of mankind. It's just a software distribution method.

There are pros and cons.

Main cons:

* Storage needs are higher with flatpaks than system packages, but that's up to a certain point. The shared runtimes take a lot of disk space, but eventually, you'll have most runtimes available, and future flatpaks you install won't need extra space.
* The need to tweak permissions with Flatseal is not pleasing, but that happens mostly because of poorly packaged apps.
* Some flatpak applications don't work properly. But, again, it's a packaging or application issue, not flatpak-specific.

Pros:

* The killer feature is the ease of use. Many distributions come with an app store that interfaces with Flathub, making it easy to have recent versions of hundreds of good programs. Software versions available on many distro repositories are usually ancient.
* Apps are containerized, keeping the base OS clean, and making it much more resilient.
* Updating apps is a breeze.
* Unlike Snap, it doesn't make app startup slower."

What does installing a package actually mean?,"Let's say I am on a barebones system with only the kernel, a filesystem, and busybox to act as the shell. How would I go about installing a package?

This is more of a ""whats under the hood"" question. I know there are minimal distros out there but that is not what I am looking for. I just want to understand how package installation works and why some packages only work for certain distros/etc. Any links to writeups on these internals or other references would also be appreciated","Every package manager works differently. This is what `dpkg` (Debian) does.

1. `apt` downloads .deb files from remote repositories and resolves all dependencies. The lot of .deb files are handed off to `dpkg` for installation.
2. Each .deb file contains some metadata and the binaries, configuration files, assets, and libraries that need to be installed. The .deb package is actually nothing more than a simple archive file. Inside that archive is the `control` file. This contains information like the package version, the dependencies, who the maintainer is, the name, and a short description. It also contains a miniature Linux file system. You'll see a /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /var, and more in the archive.
3. Upon installation, the contents of these folders are copied verbatim into the real /usr, /var, /etc, and so on.
4. A post-install script is sometimes run to start or restart affected system services, prepare configuration files, or anything else that might need to be done."

Also appreciate other tips you guys have on switching to linux.","For Blender-ing, designing and coding, any distro is good

For customizable, as you are a Blender user and designer you won't be overwhelmed by the level of customization, as others do, found with KDE Plasma. You may not be knowing about KDE Plasma. It is a Desktop Environment.

A desktop environment is one which contains all the GUI elements you see, like the windows, Taskbars, menus, buttons, mouse pointer, etc. And KDE Plasma is one of the many Desktop Environments (DEs) available for Linux. Windows has only one DE with one major version (i.e. XP, 7, 8, 10 have different DEs).

Even though with you learning curve isn't a problem, still I will recommend to go with some user-friendly distro like Linux Mint. It doesn't have KDE Plasma though, it has another DE called Cinnamon. If you want to try out KDE Plasma, Kubuntu (a flavor of Ubuntu) is a solid choice.

Same is the case for learning Linux. Start with a user-friendly Linux distro and get on with other ""non-user-friendly"" distros like Debian, Arch Linux, Manjaro later.

Can I have Windows installed on my C drive and Linux installed on my D drive? How can I go about doing this safely?,"Hi. I'm interested in pursuing a career in computer science and figured that learning Linux and doing most of my coding there would be beneficial, however I'm still interested in my pc being a predominantly windows machine.

I've already  had data on the drive (though an operating system has never been installed on it) and I'm not sure it's all gone, will Ubuntu erase this data automatically or is this something I should do before hand?

> Is that true? 

No.

It has that reputation because people don't do basic [maintenance](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_maintenance) on their rolling release system, break it themselves, and then complain that Arch is unstable on forums. The way you break Arch 99% of the time is because you didn't properly maintain your system.

- Never do 'blind' updates of your system. Every time updates become available, I first check which packages can be updated (`checkupdates`), then go to the recent [Arch news](https://www.archlinux.org/news/) posts to see if any of the updates need manual intervention. 

- Don't do [partial updates](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_maintenance#Partial_upgrades_are_unsupported).

- Don't install random packages off Github/AUR/Internet if you're not 100% certain they do what they say they do.

- Don't just copy and paste commands you don't understand in to the terminal.

- Keep regular backups.

- Have an LTS kernel installed alongside the upstream kernel so you can drop in to that should anything weird happen on an update.

- Always read and use the [official documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Main_page).

- Make sure you have the correct drivers installed for your hardware."

I have to thank Arch for finally making me comfortable with the terminal after 3 years of linux.,"I've always used linux on dual boot. Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Bodhi Linux, Manjaro.

I just installed Linux and got on with my work which was mostly browsing and writing. Coz Windows was slow on my old machine.        
     
Till I used arch, I actually thought that people changed distros just so they could change how their desktop looked and felt. Or how the app dock looked. Or how the app icons looked. That's what I actually thought that Linux flavours meant! Even after 2-3 years of using Linux.       
   
Now after installing arch, and using it for a month.  I can finally say I'm inching towards comfort with linux. Atleast on a beginner level. I still feel myself missing some features of windows every now and then. Especially when doing creative work.      
   
But nowdays I actually like it when something breaks, coz I can learn something. It's a pretty cool learning experience. I was amazed when I realized how much control that I can have on my machine.

I can't promise anything, but I forwarded this thread to Levente (the Arch project leader) and he'd try look into it. But there is no promise that something can be done. We are also aware that the donation options are sub-optimal for a lot of people. Sadly SPI hasn't modernized that well."
School controlling my personal laptop,"Well my school just destroyed all my dreams of installing archlinux on my laptop.

For the cloning you can use clonezilla.

Then, you can install arch. Remove all the partitions and start fresh with a clean arch system in the process.

As long as nobody ever told you that you are not allowed to re-install the OS, they can't blame you.

Even more so, as you can show that you  have done everything to keep the original OS working as well (in a VM). Add that to the fact that you purchased this laptop -> it's yours.

The school's IT people/teachers should be very proud of you for the knowledge you are showing by achieving this. This deserves an A+."
Why does login incorrect take so long?,"Whenever I get my login password wrong, it takes around 3 seconds to reset for another attempt, which is annoying. Why is that? Is there a way to change it?

Not using a display manager, just the default tty login prompt.","By default, the faillock PAM module enforces a 2 second delay on a failed login. As per the [options in the faillock.conf manpage](https://man.archlinux.org/man/faillock.conf.5) adding a line with the option `nodelay` to `/etc/security/faillock.conf` should prevent this.

The main reason why is to rate-limit login attempts from somebody trying to guess your password. This is mostly applicable to remote (over the network) login attempts. There are also [timing attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack) where knowing the time taken to process an input can be used to crack an algorithm, but I think the main reason for the login delay is rate limiting."
Need help to start maintaining an AUR package,"Hi guys, many years ago I created [zaread](https://github.com/paoloap/zaread) office/ebook viewer. It was meant initially as a ""personal use"" script I made mainly because I hated being forced to open LibreOffice (with its RAM usage and bloaty buttons) every time I needed to see the content of a doc file. I uploaded the script on github in case anyone needed a similiar thing, then just forgot about it.

Then few days ago, checking github after a long time, I discovered that many people adopted it and even made some patches. Also I discovered that a person of good will created and maintained the related AUR package, named [zaread-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/zaread-git).

So, moved by the sense of guilt of my disappearing, I checked the pull requests made in the years, reordered the code, fixed some bugs I discovered and committed on github. Then I reported the updates in its AUR page. The problem is that the creator of zaread-git AUR package is not an Arch user anymore and asks for a new maintainer.

Now I feel the responsability of maintaining it, my problem is that, despite being a >10 years Arch user... I never did it before. To me AUR packages always have been one of those ""magic"" things the computer does to simplify your work.I would like to give to it a mandatory dependency (zathura) and some optional dependencies (libreoffice, calibre, md2pdf).

Does anyone know if there are tutorials that explain how to start from scratch? I know that there is an helper (clean-chroot-manager) but its man page is a bit thin.

Thanks!","https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD 

This page contains most of the things you'd need to know. If you've never gone through any PKGBUILD, I suggest going through some PKGBUILDs yourself to get a hang of it. 
You already know what your program depends on, and those programs go into `depends`. Optional dependencies go to `optdepends`. You also know what packages are needed to build your reader. These go into `makedepends`. So on and so forth. 

Read the page I linked. It will solve most of your queries and help you write a PKGBUILD quite easily."

Please don't be mean to new people.,"I know you tell them to read the friendly manual, but can you be nicer about it, also it would be a help to copy and paste the specific part of the manual, or hell even a previous reddit conversation on said problem.","Well this does not usually happen if you include some research from your own part. When people ask questions like what is systemd?, this actually can be found after a simple google search. And if you ask this question in a subreddit, people tend to dismiss what you have to say because you have not learnt how to learn without being spoonfed. And being spoonfed is amazing and spoonfeeding someone is very annoying. Im not advocating that you should not ask questions, just be more specific and show that you have done a bit of research from your part before asking in reddit or stack overflow. People are more welcoming if you can show that you did some google and tried out few solutions by yourself.

This often happen because a lot of people simply resort to ask questiond whenever they want to change something than actually going through it themselves or dedicating some time to search up. Good luck. 😁"

Pacman and yay,"Hello!!!

I'm new to arch and have been using it since Jan 1st. So far no complaints at all! Loving the experience!

Quick question tough: I enabled yay and use it when needed. 

Should I prefer to always use yay instead of pacman? Or this question doesn't make any sense and I'll be using both and have to keep upgrading stuff through both?

In my mind everything in the official repo under pacman is also available in yay but I could be very wrong here. For example, if I yay -Syu all the packages I installed through yay are going to be upgraded or is yay also looking for official repo packages?

*My expectations from the distro* :- I don't know much of the technicality but I want a distro that **DOES NOT CONSUME MUCH BATTERY** like Windows does. Correct me if I am wrong here because I heard that Linux consumes less power than Windows ?? And also the distro should align with my work / career path . It will be better if it supports very light gaming but it is negotiable , the former points are non negotiable .

Should I choose arch as my first distro?,"Hi, reddit!

I'm currently thinking about switching from windows to Linux and there are three reasons for that:

1. I'm kinda tired of windows as an operating system
2. I'm studying programming on my own thus I try to find a way to make myself understand computers better even if I don't feel like I'm in mood to (ya know that feeling when u r just demotivated)
3. A friend of mine offered me to switch to arch with him

Beside that there are couple more things to mention:

1. I do not want to go for virtual environment or dual core so that I have no fast way back
2. I live in Russia and I'm not sure if it will be possible to download everything I need ( or will it?)

With this being said, here are my questions:

1. Should I choose arch, if not what suits the described case better in your opinion?
2. Do you have any general recommendations, if so what are they?

Any way thank you for reading that, will be happy to get some advises!

  
UPD: thanks everyone for answers, I do really appreciate your efforts. Anyway now I'm a happy Arch user. Even tho I'm a complete newbie, arch is just insanely comfortable to use, main rule for me now is - if you dont have something -> download, you will surely be able to, if sth went wrong and is not working now -> go google and fix it, you will surely be able to.  
For all of those who said that troubleshooting on arch is hard, well, you were right, but it's godamn funny. I lack words to decribe the emotions I got after fixing the trouble on arch for the first time(it took me sth around 6 hours tho). With that being metioned, troubles on arch aren't making ux worse, they make it better.

Summing up, Arch is nice and userfriendly, if you love computers - go download it rn!","I’d really recommend using an easier distribution for at least a few months before trying Arch. Play with the command line there heavily. When you feel comfortable then try Arch.

It's mistakes like these that teaches us to be more careful with which devices we install to!

You can post the log here for others like myself to look at by using the following:  

journalctl -b | curl -s -F'file=@-' [http://0x0.st](http://0x0.st)

Using Fingerprint In Place of Password Throughout Password Prompts (not gdm/login) [Gnome/Arch],"Hi all,



So, I've gotten fingerprint login setup through fprintd on arch/gnome, and am satisfied with the same.  There's lots of posts and quality information on this.



I was also able to get sudo working w/ fingerprint by editing the ""sudo"" text file in /etc/pam.d.  



However, I remember in Fedora that I'd get a fingerprint prompt throughout gnome, entirely in the place of a password; a good example of this is when unlocking the print menu in gnome settings, or resizing a partition in disks.



I'm trying to accomplish the same with Arch, and use fingerprint in place of a password virtually all of the time.  Help appreciated.  

While I'm here, I'll also ask if it's dangerous to change the gnome keyring password to blank so that  I can login w/ fingerprint w/o duplicitously entering the password.

For transparency, I'll be posting this in r/gnome as well.","> Add ```pam_fprintd.so``` as sufficient to the top of the auth section of ```/etc/pam.d/system-local-login```:
```
auth      sufficient pam_fprintd.so
auth      include   system-login
...
```

> You can also modify other files in ```/etc/pam.d/{login,su,sudo,gdm,lightdm}``` in the same way. For example ```/etc/pam.d/polkit-1``` for polkit based authentication (GNOME & many other desktop environments) or ```/etc/pam.d/kde``` for unlocking KDE's lockscreen.

FYI the password prompt you are describing comes from polkit.

Dose arch even support this app?,"So I'm currently engaged in a course on ofsec and pen testing. This course requires the use of virtual environments, the particular hypervisor I'm trying to install is by broadcom...

I recently installed the gcc-12 dependency, which I thought would already be included in the arch Distro  this took my computer nearly 5 hours to complete! But Vmware is built on C++ so I needed to do this step first.

The second thing was to obtain Vmware from one of two sources: AUR or .Bundle 



I installed from the .bundle, on attempting to run the application I get the following dialogue: ""Before you can run Vmware,several modules must be compiled and loaded into the running kernal."" 

then:

""Unable to install all modules.see log /tmp/vmware-myusername/vmware-2001.log for details. (Exit code 1)""



The log shows several instances where VMware is attempting to load configuration files but fails because the files are not found. These include:

/usr/lib/vmware/settings

/home/myusername/.vmware/config

/home/myusername/.vmware/preferences



In each case, VMware defaults to using its internal settings.



I'm not sure what the next step should be as I'm pretty new arch and still learning about this distro. I feel like there is something really obvious I should already know how to do but my brain just isn't on it today.



any help or suggestions are very much appreciated.

"installing arch, wifi drivers, and storage problems?","Hi there friends, I’ve recently started to make the jump to arch after getting really big into vim/nvim.

I’m trying to duel boot it along with windows right now, i’ve partitioned 50GB just to get started and eventually i plan to get an entirely new SSD for arch.

i’ve been following some tutorials and what not but i’ve come into the problem about downloading wifi drivers.
i’m in a spot where i can’t use ether net, but i have an additional USB that i’ve downloaded the drivers onto. (I have a tp link wifi adapt so i also had to get some fix off of github to get it to work, tbh idk)

after trying to use the makefile for the thingy it said that i didn’t have make installed.
okay so i put another thing on my 2d usb and i sudo pac-man -U mac.zst or whatever and it works.

then i go on and try the make file again, oh i dont have gcc installed?? okay so i try and do the same thing (this time with a few more dependencies) but im unable to because it says that ive ran out of space.

i got no clue what to do, i cant find anything near the problem im having and i could really use some help.

"Going back to Linux but need help, like a lot of help","I have a PC with pretty good specs;

• Core i7 10th Gen 2.60GHz
• RTX 2060M
• 1TB NVMe
• 16GB DDR4 RAM

But the reason I switched to Windows was because you all know the issue with Linux and the NVIDIA drivers, I've switched to Windows because my verdict was that NVIDIA basically made Windows feel proprietary with their hardware which I guess sorta makes sense but if I'm being honest I am getting sick of the constant distro hop. One minute, Linux feels right, next minute, Windows feels right because NVIDIA basically made it feel right by making it work the best with their GPUs.

Been using Arch for a few months, it was a great time when it lasted but you know, there are some aspects of Windows that can't be replicated elsewhere such as the compatibility which you all know, this of course along with NVIDIA associate with my switch to Windows. I'm planning to make a comeback to Arch but to those Arch users that are reading this, put yourself in my scenario, what would you do? I do have issues making in real life decisions if that has anything to do with this, I struggle to make my mind up and often take an extremely long time processing my options and choosing the right one. If you can relate to this, great XD

But honestly, I don't know what's right for me now.

Windows literally caps my CPU at 0.78GHz but Linux doesn't. I kinda believe Linux has better communication with the hardware because I've discovered that Windows lowers the voltage my CPU gets by a significant amount, I don't use any tools to fix this, I will never touch Afterburner I just don't don't trust myself with it XD

Also, since my CPU is a 10th Gen, I can undervolt it which is great but it doesn't do a single thing, I don't think it's meant to do much other than lowering the voltage the CPU gets without compromising performance. The CPU isn't undervolted right now.

This may seem like a lot I've given in this post but seriously, I don't know what to do. It has been well over 30 minutes and the CPU is still at 0.78GHz what should I do?","download arch iso as per the India server to download  fast and flash it into the usb then plug it into system then boot into iso

Can’t log in,"So I was trying to manually install arch from a usb following the wiki installation guide, when pacstraping “ base linux linux-firmware “ it crashed like 4 times with various errors so I opted for “arch install” which also crashed 2 times before successfully installing, now when i try to log in it says I’m using the wrong password (I’ve tried root password aswell). I tried to chroot through the usb to remount my partitions to create a new passwd but “ mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot “ returns 
“ mount: /mnt/boot: mount point does not exist. “ I’ve tried mounting to /mnt/boot/EFI AND /efi but neither of those exist either. I also tried pressing “e” while the “arch Linux” option is highlighted in GRUB and wrote “init=/bin/bash” which did nothing. I tried mounting /dev/nvme0n1p1 to /mnt and got “mount: /mnt: fsconfig system call failed: /nvme01n1: can’t lookup block dev “ 
I activated disk encryption for the root partition during installation and am able to get into the user login screen so I’m not sure why one password is recognized and the other isnt. Very lost any help is greatly appreciated. 

Currently trying “control+alt+f3” to login through another tty but still says “login incorrect”","if you are on the live USB /mnt/boot/ will not exist by default. Also that's not how you should be mounting things. You should also never use archinstall for a first time install, as if something breaks not only will you not be able to fix it yourself, but you likely will not even know what broke. This is why it is suggested to install arch manually in a VM, then use arch install on actual hardware.

Because you used disk encryption you will have to reinstall. Unless you are worried about people IRL trying to steal your data, you should never encrypt your disk. Because disk encryption means if you ever fuck up your computer, or crash during a kernel update you will be fucked

For educational purposes, here's how you could have mounted your filesystem if you didnt encrypt your disk

* use `df -l` and find your linux storage partition
* mount that storage partition `mount /dev/sdx1 /mnt` replace /dev/sdx1 with your storage partition
* `arch-chroot /mnt`
* now mount your boot partition `mount /dev/sdx2 /boot`
* change your root password `passwd`
* change your user password `passwd {insert your username here}`"

"[KDE Plasma 6.1, Nvidia 555] Intermittent application stuttering on Wayland applications","Hello,  
I have just recently updated my Nvidia drivers on my Arch Linux PC to version 555. After updating, programs under XWayland run well and have lost their stuttering whereas native Wayland programs and desktop environment now seem to stutter and feel laggy. I have tried the Grub fix as stated in [https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/major-kde-plasma-desktop-frameskip-lag-issues-on-driver-555/293606](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/major-kde-plasma-desktop-frameskip-lag-issues-on-driver-555/293606) (`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""quiet splash nvidia.NVreg_EnableGpuFirmware=0""` and rebuilding Grub) but the issues seems to persist.

If you have any ideas what may be the problem and how I may fix it please let me know before I downgrade back to the 550 driver.","This won't help you specifically, but the ""Grub fix"" you linked worked for me (Wayland, kwin, Plasma 6.1.2, Nvidia 555.58.02, RTX 3070 Ti),  so I'll add some context for others who come across this looking for a solution.

Driver version 555 is the first version with which offloading of some initialization/management tasks to a component on the GPU called the GSP is enabled by default on all Turing (In Geforce terms, that's the RTX 20 series) and later GPUs (It was previously disabled by default on at least all Geforce GPUs, as far as I can tell). This *currently* seems to cause issues with some configurations, but should otherwise and in the future be a good thing for performance. Setting the `nvidia` kernel module parameter `NVreg_EnableGpuFirmware=0` (which you may do using the kernel command line as OP and I did) forces this feature off again, and therefore may resolve those issues. See Nvidia's Linux driver documentation chapter on the GSP for [version 555](https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/555.58.02/README/gsp.html) and the previous [version 550](https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/550.90.07/README/gsp.html). I can't currently find out anything more about where exactly the problem lies.

You may wish to check if you are currently using the GSP. Per Nvidia's documentation, the output of `nvidia-smi -q` should include a key ""GSP Firmware Version"", with the value `N/A` if GSP is currently *disabled* and a version value like `550.90.07` if it's *enabled*. So, run something like `nvidia-smi -q | grep GSP`.

To reiterate what I did to fix the issue on my end, risking excessive detail because I'm always frustrated with how little detail/explanations other people provide:

1. Edit `/etc/default/grub`. Find the key `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`. To the end of the existing string value add a space and `nvidia.NVreg_EnableGpuFirmware=0`. This means specifying the `nvidia` kernel module parameter mentioned on the kernel command line, although just editing this file doesn't actually change the grub configuration yet; it influences the generation of a new one.
2. In case something goes wrong, save a copy of my current `/boot/grub/grub.cfg`, as I'm about to overwrite this file.
3. Run `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg` (with sudo). This generates a new grub config, using the change I made to `/etc/default/grub`, and outputs it to the location expected by grub.

Arguably the nicer way to do it would be using a configuration file in `/etc/modprobe.d/`. At least I don't see why that shouldn't be equivalent. But it's not what I did and I'm too lazy to check if it actually does what I expect."

reccomended WM,"Hi, is there any recommendation WM for a developer?

I just need the workspace bar, and network, wolume work. no need fancy stuff","WM themselves dont come with a bar, volume or network manager programs, but for most cases you should be good with waybar(wayland) or polybar(x11) for your bar.

for Bluetooth read the arch wiki, its pretty easy configuring bluetooth with bluez

For Volume Ive heard about pavumixer, but again, look at the wiki, installing the program is not actuhard and works out of the box

for network I havent solved that yet to myself so I just use nmtui, which comes with the networkmanager package, which you likely already have installed

All this advice is based off on ""No need fancy stuff"". But you can customize your WM as you'd like. Im having a great experience with hyprland, its wiki is very well documented, but if you want to get into customization you shouldn't have much of a problem if you use dwm, i3, or awesome.

Please do NOT try Arch linux just because PewDiePie did,"Firstly what this is about:  Arch linux will frustrate newcomers.

The thing that doesn't add up is him calling himself ""not a technical guy"" and then going ahead with a notoriously hard distro and doing a bunch of things that are arguably things that takes effort.

Lastly, I do fear that he did the Linux community a disfavor by basically promoting Arch linux, despite his disclaimers and explanation that it is a difficult to use distro, to non-technical people..... Hmmmm, hopefully I'm wrong.  

TL:DR - try some other distros before you jump into Arch.","The real requirement for technically demanding distros is not that you're already tech-savvy, but that you're willing to bang your head against the wall for days if a problem demands it. You can become tech-savvy in the process."
Not able to open Porn sites on any browser,"So I just fresh installed Linux Mint and am facing this issue with all browsers (tested on chrome, brave, Firefox) where any porn site just keeps loading without showing any errors. I have no Internet issues as well as other sites load fine. It seems to be some kind of firewall but I don't know what. Also it's not my isp since I can load them on another devices using the same wifi network.

Edit: This post blew up way more than I expected it to. Other than the great jokes there were some great solutions. I tried using VPN and I think it works sometimes now. I don't get enough time from work to test other solutions so will try during weekends. Nevertheless the replies have been hilarious on this thread xD

Edit 2: The issue is now resolved, yes it was a dns problem. Thank you to everyone who gave a solution and other who cracked great jokes!",You gotta install the goon package
For the influx of users who came to try Linux after Pewdiepie's video,"Heya, have you watched Pewdiepie's video of using Linux, read a bit about stuff, then got interested? Good!!

2 great distros you can begin with, are:

1. Linux Mint
2. Fedora

These two are great beginning points, and they offer things fairly easily to the user. They both have App Stores (similar to the Microsoft Store, except much better). Fedora offers a bit more up to date packages than Mint, but Mint is also great because of its simplicity and ease of use.

(This is purely based off of general opinion and view, its what a lot of the community uses, and is a great starting point for Linux.)

**VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND:**

Not all games work. About 90% of them do, but anticheat oriented games (usually, some of them do work) dont work. Games like Valorant, Fortnite, LOL, Apex Legends for example dont run on Linux due to them being very Anti-Linux and they refuse to accept Linux users. Most games however, should work just fine at this point.

Keep an open mind! Linux is a learning experience, finding new apps, learning the terminal, if something doesnt work, **dont be afraid to ask others!!**
It's how we as a community grow.
And most of all, have fun. Customize your desktop to your liking, find apps you like and explore. It's all a learning experience.","And remember, this is a big chance for Linux to gain some market share. Do try and help and be gentle about newbie and basic questions. Everyone starts somewhere and WILL run into problems and have 'stupid' questions. Elitists refusing to help is a big hindrance towards adoption."
How insane is the stuff Pewdiepie showed off?,"Assume the reader never touched Linux in his life, or at most did a tiny bit of ""ls"", ""cd"" and maybe most basic ""tmux"" at work

Just how insane and time consuming are the things Felix showed off in his video?
- Speeding up the boot time
- Speeding up Firefox
- Custom animated stuff in the terminal
- Fixing F1-F12 keys of his laptop key by key
- His whole Arch UI (was he likely using mostly pre-built widgets from some.. tool, package or something? Or was every single element likely designed and then scripted by himself?)
- The fading transitions on Arch (technically UI too, I guess)

He showed off stuff he was excited about (which I totally get) but I did think it was a big shame that the video didn't provide much context on how easy/insane the things he did were","They are all very easy if you have some experience and put some time in to learning. None of it is S Tier level difficult. What PewDiePie demonstrated though is that he was willing to put in the time and effort to find out how to fix these issue and customize his system, he also showed a genuine excitement for the freedom that Linux gives you. I have nothing but good things to say about what he demonstrated. 

He used  systemd-analyze blame if I remember correctly. This will tell you the time services took to start on bootup. However whilst you can disable them all that wouldn't be a good idea, so he would have had to work out which ones to disable or pause etc

With Firefox he probably enabled hardware acceleration, he may also have had too many extensions running and weeded out the ones that he didn't need. He may have simply cleared the cache or setup preload

He used Neofetch in his terminal however this is the only part where I can remember thinking ok he doesn't know about Fastfetch and that is generally preferred now due to lack of ongoing support with Neofetch.

To fix the F keys he must have looked at the Arch Wiki, this is one of the best documentations on Linux and Arch and every experienced Linux user has probably referenced it

[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Extra\_keyboard\_keys](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Extra_keyboard_keys)

For his ricing he was using Hyprland as the Window manager, Hyprland runs on Wayland which is the compositor. Generally you have either Wayland or X11. If you have Nvidia GPU then the preference is X11. I run X11 myself as it seems to work niceer with Nvidia. Maybe that has changed now I'll find out whenever I change to a Wayland based distro. For the widgets he may have been using Eww. The swapping of desktops is built into most Linux desktop environments. Even Windows has had this for some time now I believe.

The top bar he used Waybar and a script to minimise it depending on his workflow, he didn't say if he created the script or not, or found a script or modified an existing one. 

For the search launcher he uses Rofi.

None of this is difficult stuff but it takes time to discover all this, so he did the work. Is he a competent Linux admin now? Nothing he showed demonstrates that he is BUT considering the progress he made I'm sure he could be a decent programmer and sysadmin because he was enjoying what he was doing and loved discovering how to do things and that is half the battle.

I apologise if there are mistakes in the above, that is my take on it."
"My brother is proof you can be a complete idiot, and still use Linux.","So I have a younger brother (for the purposes of this post, will be referred to as bulb) who I've managed to convince to use Linux mint. He's been using it for about a few months now, and besides some minor troubleshooting, he seems to be doing just fine. The other day, I decided to ask him what he knows about Linux at this point. After some talking, apparently he doesn't even know why some commands are prefaced with ""sudo"". While initially feeling like a furious teacher, I realize now how convenient Linux can be for someone who knows little about the ecosystem.","The problem isn't the idiot that knows he's an idiot.

Linux problem is the person with just enough knowledge to hang themselves.

It generally doesn't save you from yourself."
Why is the Linux filesystem so complicated?,"I have a few questions regarding why so much directories are available in the Linux filesystem and why some of them even bother existing:

\- Why split `/bin`and `/sbin`?  
\- Why split `/lib` and `/lib64?`  
\- Why is there a `/usr` directory that contains duplicates of `/bin`, `/sbin`, and `/lib`?  
\- What is `/usr/share` and `/usr/local`?  
\- Why are there `/usr`, `/usr/local` and `/usr/share` directories that contain`/bin`, `/sbin`, `lib`, and`/lib64` if they already exist at `/`(the root)?  
\- Why does `/opt` exist if we can just dump all executables in `/bin`?  
\- Why does `/mnt` exist if it's hardly ever used?  
\- What differs `/tmp` from `/var`?","/bin - binaries for all to use

/sbin - system admin binaries that should be usable by systems administrators, but are less interesting to regular users

/lib - libraries

/lib64 - as 64bit binaries were being created, they needed their own place for libraries since the 32bit and 64bit version often had the same name.

/usr - UNIX System Resources, is where sysv unix put their binaries and apps, where /bin, /sbin, and /lib is where Berkeley Unix put their apps, so this is a holdover for Unix compatibility.  The Red Hat distros have the Berkeley places as symlinks to their /usr counterparts so there’s really only one directory, but packages built using older file locations still work.

/usr/local - applications unique to this system

/usr/share - for shared applications (could be setup as NFS or other to allow other systems to use these apps.

/opt- optional (3rd party applications).  Basically non-native to the distro apps so that you know what you got from your OS and what was extra from someone else. (Very few packagers use this)

/mnt - a premade place to mount things into the machine (there are now others like the desktops will use directories in /run and the like.)

/tmp- temporary files, this directory is also world writable by any user or process on the system.

/var- variable length files.  Things like logs, print spool, Mail spool, you may not be able to predict how much you’ll have so you put them here, on a separate filesystem so that if you do get an unexpectedly large amount, it fills the /var filesystem, but doesn’t crash the box by filling the entire filesystem.

"I get it, it's just a tool. (Linux taught me a life lesson.)","Switched to Linux from Windows 3 weeks ago (CachyOS) and the first 10 days or so I was going wild with the constant reinstalling, distro-hopping and tweaking. I was feeling this weird dopamine hit from setting up a new Distro/DE and tweaking it, adding new applets, extensions and such. Watching the terminal flow as I was executing a new command feeling a weird happiness from it etc. I think it was also a way of escaping my real responsibilities for a while but that's another topic.

Some time passed and I finally felt satisfied with my system. It was just working and honestly I was seriously getting stressed and tired of constant tinkering. So I decided to just leave it as it is and do what I normally do on a computer. For a while I kept waiting everyday for the rush of watching the system update in the terminal via ""sudo pacman -Syu"" I know, it's weird but it just felt good for some reason.

After some days I decided to let that one go as well and update only once in a couple of days instead of trying the command every 2-3 hours for the dopamine.

Now, the rush of ""switching to Linux"" has passed and my computer has become just a tool once again. I just turn it on, do my business and leave. Nothing special. No more tinkering, no more looking for a new flatpak or some terminal gimmick. It's just my computer.

This makes me realize Linux is not some crazy wild unthinkable dare. It's just an OS, and it's not that different. I just do whatever I used to do when I was using Windows and now my  Linux computer feels like something I'm used to, something home. If ya know what I mean. It's just like Windows but better, lighter, more user friendly, personal and open-source.

Honestly viewing my computer/system this way feels much better and cozier. It truly feels mine and familiar. Not changing things constantly gradually builds up a sense of familiarity that gives a different kind of happiness and calmness when you are using your computer. It's like it's there for you, whenever you need it, just the way it is, just the way you know it to be. For you to use it, for your help. This is such a good feeling.

I certainly felt the same rush of dopamine from ricing, tweaking etc. so I understand folks who are into that but I am getting old and I have other responsibilities and this way of using my computer just feels right and the way it was supposed to be used. It also has it's own unique way of feeling home. Another sort of dopamine.

Now I am no longer flexing to my friends how I switched to Linux and how I am using this cool distro and DE sending them screenshots and such. I just use Linux, that's it. nothing big, nothing crazy. It's just my computer and it's the way I like it, nothing big. Everyone has things they like/ used to and this is just one of them. And if someone notices that my computer looks a bit different I just casually mention ""oh yeah I use Linux it's just a different OS"" if they are curious about it I answer but I don't go too eager to show it to them. Weirdly enough this natural behavior makes them much more interested in it in the long run.

I think this has taught me something about life itself. When we get too invested in constantly getting more and better we are putting ourselves in the risk of missing out on actually appreciating something in a boring way and that is truly something special. Like a morning coffee that you just drink in a certain way every single day and the sound of the rain you like just because it is the way it is from your room. The wallpaper in your walls and the sense of familiarity it brings when you get home from a long trip. This way of appreciation of the boring things makes life richer and reliable which in turn gives way to a sense of stability and constancy allowing you to focus on growing and expanding on the foundation of things that just work on their own so that you don't have to worry about them.

I know I am a bit of a philosophizer but I felt the desire to share this for a  couple of days now so excuse my rambling, hope you guys are having a good day.",Congratulations - you have arrived  :)
Take it from a veteran: dont start with arch,"tl;dr Dont recommend arch to new people comers, pretty please? People who like the arch way, will find their way there eventually for sure. Arch people, Why do you hate linux? Why dont you want it to become more wide-spread?

---

Arch approach is 'you either learn to swim or you die' is fucking stupid **FOR NOOBS**

When you learn math, you first learn addition, then subtraction, then multiplication, then division, then the harder stuff

You learn to walk, then to run

Thats how you learn everything else. Why cant you see this is not a good way to learn linux either?

I used to think linux was hard and failed to make the switch a few times. Just because i thought linux was too hard and time consuming for me... :(

Now that i know a lot about linux, i think thats really not true at all. I managed to have everybody around me using ubuntu and, most difficult, to like it. (Disclaimer: i dont use ubuntu myself)

95% of all distros are made of the same stuff. Starting with something hard is fucking retarded and we have here only stories of the people who survived instead of the stories of the people going back to windows because they thought linux was hard

Arch is survivor bias at its peak of stupidity. I swear to god that new comers that overcome the barrier reach peak stupidity and tries to infect others with their disease like they have become enlightened

I like to fiddle **a lot** in linux. Its great compared with windows. But I like to do this with a few packages i care about. The rest, i just want them to work. This is true for the vast majority. Specially new people starting

You can have everything working and learn one package the same in any distro, all while having the rest of you distro working. Arch is not special in that way at all. You learn in small bits at your own pace and you are not REQUIRED to learn something

You can even use the arch wiki to learn while in other distro

Why arch is not good for new comers:

 * By design, they touch upstream the least amount. A good distro will remove things from upstream that are bad for the user. The user is the priority, not the developer
 * This also implies that things are not standarized either. A good distro will try to make everything homogeneous and work in a similar fashion even if they come from different sources. Again by design. It creates expectations on the users. In Arch you will have to learn upstream of every package
 * AUR is not fucking curated. Yes, malware is found there from time to time
 * New comers come from windows, not to from other linux distro. If they fail to make the switch, they come back to windows
 * They are memeing arch to make it appealing to people that dont know better. In a way, it feels they are being tricked. And i dont really like when people is taken advantage of

Please, instead of installing arch because you are memed into it, read their [principles](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux#Principles) to see if they appeal to you

PS:

I acknowledge that people that uses arch linux like to learn about linux and that as a whole is great, but i wont sacrifice a potential new linux user that just uses it and chill just in the off case they might enjoy more the 'swim or die' arch way

I also acknowledge that this particular style is good for a few people, but not for the majority of people","People who recommend Arch to new users of Linux are either idiots that do not want to see Linux grow and purposely are trying to damage Linux's reputation as a credible alternative to OS X and Windows, presumably for some elitest reason or trolls. 

The reality is that the vast majority of people who try Linux will be coming from Windows and those same people will not be technical minded. 

They are used to the Windows way of thinking with GUI tools, so only now to be told that they will have to build a system from scratch will do one of two things, frustrate them and send them straight back to Windows with the same old stereotypes about Linux reaffirmed. 

I agree that as a community we should have preferences on our favourite distributions, but for the mindset of new user, we really should be recommending distributions with the most polish and user friendliness, for example Linux Mint or Ubuntu. 

Arch can come later once they have a firm grasp of Linux, certainly not at the beginning.

An open letter to Linux noobs regarding Kali Linux.,"With alarming frequency I see posts on this subreddit involving relatively basic troubleshooting questions from users running Kali Linux. I wrote this as a response to that. I think Kali Linux is great. I just don't think everybody should be using it as a desktop OS.

**The TL;DR for this post could be taken straight from the [Kali FAQ](http://docs.kali.org/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux)**: ""If you are unfamiliar with Linux generally, if you do not have at least a basic level of competence in administering a system, if you are looking for a Linux distribution to use as a learning tool to get to know your way around Linux, or if you want a distro that you can use as a general purpose desktop installation, Kali Linux is probably not what you are looking for.""

*Dear Linux noobs,*

Linux is cool. You're interested in Linux and that makes you cool too. You should be proud of your interest in Linux. You're now part of a community that is full of cool people (OK, a few of us are jerks, but what can you do).

What else is cool? Computer hacking. Password cracking. Network penetration. These things are neat, and the people who can do them are usually pretty cool too (though some of them are jerks too). Learning to do these things is fun, and if you want to do it, you should. When practiced responsibly, these things can make fun hobbies, or even a lucrative career. The purpose of this post is not to discourage anybody from learning to do these things.

One of the major problems new Linux users face when starting out is figuring out which Linux distribution is right for them. There are a lot of options after all. Everybody likes to recommend their favorite distro (and also occasionally give their opinion on their least favorite distro). Very frequently I see questions in this subreddit, and in related subreddits, like ""What distro should I use?"", ""I want to learn to code, what distro would be good for me?"", ""What is the best distro for python programming?"", or ""What distro should I use to learn penetration testing?"". New Linux users who might be interested in penetration testing (or some other related topic) might, by some means or another, discover Kali Linux. They might think ""Hey, I want to learn Linux and also pen-testing! I should use Kali Linux."" They'd probably be wrong.

The thing is, most desktop distributions provide access to the same software. If you want to watch Youtube videos and write email, Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, etc, are all equally capable of that. If you want to learn python programming, you can do that on any of those distributions. Similarly, if you want to learn pen-testing, you can do it from any of those distributions.

Kali Linux is a distribution specifically designed to be a toolkit for professional pen-testers. As such, it might be very attractive to new Linux users who are interested in security. However, Kali is /not/ designed as a general purpose Linux distro. Some elements of it's design are simply not suited for use as a general purpose desktop. If you're a new Linux user who installs Kali Linux chances are you will have a frustrating experience. The Kali Linux maintainers even have a FAQ page ""Is Kali Linux right for me?"" 

http://docs.kali.org/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux

Please read that article before deciding to use Kali as a desktop OS, especially if you're new to Linux. If you don't yet understand some of the points made in that article that's probably a sign to avoid Kali for now.

It's quite often that I see people asking questions like ""How do I do X in Kali Linux?"" or ""[Kali] Y is not working. Please help."" Unfortunately these users don't usually get the help they need, which makes me sad. The posts are often dismissed or downvoted. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I'd wager that most of the people asking these questions don't need Kali. They need a desktop distribution.

I am worried that if your first adventures with Linux are in Kali you will have a frustrating experience and be turned off from the whole endeavor. Your questions might be dismissed and left unanswered because you appear to be in over your head.

*Using Kali Linux as your first desktop Linux distro is like learning to drive on a racecar. Please don't do it.*

Peace.",Thanks for writing this...and especially for writing it pretty diplomatic. I probably would have used...far too strong language. Great work.
"PSA: Please do not say ""just google it"" as an answer to everything","Please. Especially the posts that say they have googled it and not found anything, It's really annoying, disrespectful, and completely unhelpful. We already googled before we made the post. Not everyone has the same results, or problems, or computer specs.

Not only that, but it's also unhelpful to others that are genuinely trying to use google.

Imagine if you wanted to do something cool with your Linux PC (like optimise OS for gaming, customise theme, or whatever) but the only thing stopping you from doing the cool is an error or missing knowledge

so, you go to google and type ""How do i do the cool?"" (which can be anything.)

and the first result that pops up is ""Just google it""

so, you go to google and type ""How do i do the cool?"" (which can be anything.)

and the first result that pops up is ""Just google it""

and the first result that pops up is ""Just google it""

you see the problem? By saying ""Just google it"" You have created an infinite loop that drives the person who's just trying to find the answer insane. So please, actually help

ANOTHER THING TO POINT OUT: Dont also suggest using ai. not everyone's PC is expendable as yours.

DO NOT download etcher from etcher.NET!,"I made this mistake while going from windows 10 to pop os. If you're going to use etcher (balena etcher) to flash a usb go to [balena.io/etcher/].

Why don't Linux users shut down their computers?,"I follow the Linux communities on Reddit and I can't understand one thing: why not just shut down the computer? Is there any explanation for this? How does the system and the device handle it? Does it require any additional tweaks/settings or anything else? How is this different from Windows?

How and why do you do this? Thanks!",Because I'll never get Bluetooth audio to work again if I do
Opinion: Can we stop recommending less user friendly distros for noobs?,"I know we all have our choice of distribution, but when people are asking which distro to use for their first install can we stop recommending Arch or Gentoo, and start recommending actual user friendly distros like Ubuntu and derivatives, Manjaro, Fedora or openSUSE? Forcing a noob to just jump into compiling software from scratch or building their OS from the ground up doesn’t sound like the right thing to do. If we push them into more difficult distributions they might lose confidence if they break something on install and turn their back on Linux for good. If the goal is to get more people to use and stick with Linux why don’t we start recommending user friendly first and then if they request a new distro as a more experienced user then recommend Arch etc.?

Just asking the community on their thoughts on this idea because I see it a lot on posts by new users asking which distro they should install.","Petition to make a sticky thread for this subreddit that gives out exact details for each distro, their difficulty level, what each one is good for, where is each one used practically, and what sets them all apart, what they family tree line is, all that kind of stuff? It will help users just go to one place and get all their info.  


One thing I would like to add is to be really user friendly and do not show superiority complex - I have seen people angry sometimes because new people asked very basic questions. If we expect new people to migrate to Linux, might as well understand that not everyone has the same technical mind.  


That is all. Good day!"
For anyone using Ubuntu and feeling ashamed... don't!!! Ubuntu is great!,"I am disturbed by the number of people in this sub who feel shame for using Ubuntu. Listen up. Ignore whatever you read about Ubuntu not being for pros. IT IS!!

A pro is someone who uses Linux for their profession. I write software for Linux as my job and manage a fleet of thousands of Linux servers, hosting services you've more than likely used. Several of my team members use Ubuntu and we're about as pro as it gets when it comes to Linux. Why? Because it just works. The only reason I don't use Ubuntu is because I prefer Red Hat based systems, so my servers are CentOS and my desktop is Fedora. If they didn't exist, I'd be MORE than happy with Ubuntu.

Linux pros do not want to spend time tinkering with their desktop to make it look pretty. You do that shit when you're just starting out on your Linux journey. Pros use Linux for the power it grants you as a user. Ubuntu gives you the same power as any other distro. Maybe even more so because of how fucking easy it is to use.

Most of the Ubuntu naysayers are amatures who've installed Arch and now think they're experts. Pfffft. Please. Installing Arch is NOTHING SPECIAL! If they'd installed Gentoo or Linux from Scratch, I'd be a bit more impressed.

Do not listen to them. Pick a distro you like and stick with it. Ubuntu is fucking great. Enjoy it!","Hear hear.

“Distro wars” are indicative of people who haven’t used Linux all that long.

After a while you become proficient enough that you can make any installation whatever you want. You realize that for 99% it use cases it just doesn’t matter in the slightest.

Wtf Microsoft ????,"So let me get this straight.

Something finally comes CLOSE to a OneNote alternative on Linux,"Oh baby....the time has finally come. [Rnote](https://github.com/flxzt/rnote) is a hella' nice drawing/annotating tool. The formatting is brilliant, better than OneNotes' infinity canvas, and is something that is actually conducive for lecture style note-taking (Think things like [collanote](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/collanote-note-journal-pdf/id1540956268), [notability](https://notability.com/) etc); Rnote pastes material on a page, so you can draw over/on the side/ next to it. This is in opposition to the (fantastic, but not for me) [Xournal++](https://xournalpp.github.io/), that forces a pdf as the background. I've only ever seen [The Linux Experiment](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5UAwBUum7CPN5buc-_N1Fw) talk about this one & my mans' was right--this application is straight fire.

&#x200B;

Now...there are a few things missing: pdf export & audio tools to name two, but guess what homies, it can export as an .xopp, Xournal++'s file format. This means if you use them in tandem, you can pretty much get rid of OneNote, finally. A GPL licensed product that is great, love to see it.

Learn from basic linux commands to pretty advanced concepts with the bandits game!,"Hi everyone!

Yesterday I've stumbled across The Bandits game, from OverTheWire. It blew me away for how fun it was and how much it made me learn about linux with a very biref introduction to more complex concepts. I know it is probably well\-known by most of you but I belive it is a very good place for beginners to start.

"UPDATE to ""I really want to love Linux, but I'm getting sick of everything single thing I do turning into a huge ordeal""","[My thread a few days ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/ei06t7/i_really_want_to_love_linux_but_im_getting_sick/) really blew up, so I thought that I would post an update in case anybody was curious.

I expected this subreddit to tear me apart for being negative about their beloved Linux but the vast majority of what I got instead was understanding and support.

So as  much as I wanted to be an Arch badass like everybody else, I decided to make my life easier and just try striaght up Ubuntu 19.10

And it has been AWESOME!!

Now granted, a lot of that is because of everything that I've already learned so far. But for the most part, it Just Works ™

Conky works better than any other distro I've tried (they would all minimise it if I push Super + D, but on Ubuntu it works properly), TeamViewer which for some reason was compeltely broken on other distros just works perfectly without doing anything special. My brightness buttons work just fine (because why wouldn't they!?!?), hell, even my fingerprint sensor works!

Now some things were a bit different and I still had to Google a bunch of stuff. But instead of digging deep and going through tons of trial and error, the answers are easy to find and work on the first try.

Now customization-wise it is definitely much more limited than other KDE-based things, but I would definitely rather struggle with tinkering than struggle with functioning.

Thank you so much to everyone that replied to the other thread with their experiences, sympathies, and advice.

To fellow noobs: can't stress enough how useful Linuxjourney.com is,"I've used Linux for about a year now and learned a handful of stuff along the way, but man I wish I had started with Linuxjourney.com there is so much useful info there and I'm not even through the novice section yet.

Windows 10 is dying and i wanna switch to linux,"Title's pretty self explanatory. I dont wanna spend my money for windows 11 and decide i wanna migrate to linux. The problem is, which distro should i use.

• must be able to run steam and epic games

• it must run discord, gimp, blender and davinci","Quick answer: ignore the power users. Start with Linux Mint or Ubuntu. After you get a feel for Linux and you want to continue, then you can experiment with specialized or alternate distros. Lot of information is going to fly at you in this thread, just some clarifying points:

-Distros are commonly used interchangeably with OS in this world. You can think of them as versions of Linux that are maintained by different organizations. 

-The ""Desktop Environment"" is commonly what the average person would think of when they imagine an OS. This would be your user interface, system tools and default applications. The big two are KDE and Gnome. KDE looks a lot like Windows by default, Gnome resembles Mac OS a bit more. Neither will hold you back with what you want to do, so I would pick only on aesthetics and how customizable you want your setup to be (KDE gives you more control, Gnome is more streamlined and sleek). The one caveat is Linux Mint uses Cinnamon instead of the above two. It also resembles Windows.

-For your case, a lot of posters are going to recommend gaming-centric OSes. They can be really good for your needs, but you should keep in mind one thing with Linux: Community is your support, and popularity=community. The bigger distros come with more knowledge when something breaks, and if you're on a niche gaming distro, your community support will be that much smaller.

-quickly do some googling on ""immutable"". Some of the gaming distros are handheld focused (thinking of Bazzite specifically), which means they lock down your system files like a console. This can be great for newbie-proofing your system, but can also cause problems if you need a program to have access to specific files or places on your OS. I had issues with sandboxed apps when I was installing a DAW that I wanted to scan for VSTs in a part of my filesystem that was locked down. My fault, but it happens a lot when you expect full access to everything like in Windows.

-If you do a lot of competitive multiplayer gaming, I would not make this switch lightly. Use ProtonDB to check support for your favorite games. Look up how the Anti-cheat behaves on Linux. You can get locked out of specific games if you're not careful."
KDE changed my opinion of Linux,"I really don’t know what took me so long to try it, but KDE Plasma is by far the best DE I’ve used. Most of my previous frustrations with Linux turned out to really be frustrations with Gnome. We should honestly stop suggesting Gnome DE distributions to noobs. It really doesn’t make a great first impression. I think the UX is bad enough that it’s a barrier to wider adoption of desktop Linux. For anyone looking to try Linux, I would suggest starting with Kubuntu, not Ubuntu.

I tried Cinnamon and a few “lightweight” DEs too but I think they just look ugly and outdated. Plasma looks great right out of the box and also has tons of customizations available.","* Very similar to Windows 10 on default settings.
* Comes with Wayland as the default option on most distros.
* Looks pretty out of the box.
* The KDE settings app has improved a lot on KDE 6, compared to its KDE 5 version.

All in all, what is there not to like?"
"Just started using linux, holy shit this is so fun","I have been a lifelong Windows user. I am a developer so I use a Mac for my work machine and Windows for everything else.

I have a pretty beefy machine (4090, 32gb ram etc) so I've always used windows since I assumed that Linux

- Is not ready for gaming yet
- isn't optimised
- Would be a nightmare to learn, not worth it

Holy hell was I wrong. I installed Pop!_OS around 5 days ago, and in that time, I have:

- Learned far more console commands than I would have by sticking with Windows
- Borked my audio so had to re-install my OS
- Borked my steam so had to reinstall many times
- Borked Docker so had shutdown issues

But, you know something? I learned something each time since I had to diagnose it and fix it, and it gets more fun each time because its a realization of **I am in complete control of my system**.

That is something I never had in Windows. I am going to remain a dual booter since there is a couple games that only work in Windows annoyingly, but as of right now, I only have a 150gb partition for Linux, I will look into getting a 2tb SSD for it soon and hopefully make it my main OS.

Every time I run into a struggle, there is a solution. The community is very helpful (apart from a few people on this sub reddit lol)

Also, gaming has came a LONG way! Steam has Proton built in, so it means running Windows native games is a breeze (for the majority, at least)

So, for anybody who needs that little push to give Linux a go, go for it! You won't regret it!",Glad to have you on board
"Please, please stop recommending (beginners) Manjaro","Manjaro has many issues which other Linux distros do not have. For the beginner user, there are several frustrations that they may run into.

Here are some practical reasons why you should not use Manjaro:

 * Manjaro holds back Arch packages, but they do not hold back the AUR itself. This means that some AUR packages simply won't work due to incompatible library/packages, and you basically won't be able to do anything. For me this happened with Anbox, and KDE's Mauikit suite of apps, but I'm positive that this issue will occur with other packages. You don't actually get access to the full AUR, just most of it. 
 * The AUR helper that they provide, pamac is slow, and it failed to compile packages many times when I used it. However, other AUR helpers I have used (I mainly use yay) are much faster, and they very rarely fail to compile packages.
 * Although Manjaro holds back packages, they don't actually intervene when their is a bug or a similar or a similar issue. And even if they did intervene, any patches made would bring new bugs/issues, and so on. There is no real point to holding back packages, and what they do just makes the system less stable. 


Another big thing is that Arch is an entire terminal based, DIY distro, however, Manjaro has a completely opposite philosophy. Manjaro's philosophy is for users to never have to touch the terminal at all, and the clashing of philosophies of the parent distro and the derivative distro creates issues. We can see something similar with Ubuntu and Debian, but Ubuntu handles it much, much better due to the support of a larger company - support which Manjaro lacks. 

Here are some links to other articles, in which the authors point out other, more serious issues, such as unfixed security vulnerabilities. 

https://www.hadet.dev/Manjaro-Bad/

https://github.com/arindas/manjarno 

There is no true way to get ""Arch without the pain,"" because philosophy of Arch Linux brings what some users consider to be pain. If you want something close, I recommend EndeavorOS, a reputable and trusted distro with a fairly large community, or Garuda, a new and upcoming distro that has some minor issues but those can easily be overlooked. 

I don't recommend any kind of ""Arch installer,"" because by default, Arch does not come with things that many users would consider necessary, like Bluetooth or Printing. Although the Arch Wiki provides guides for setting those things up, if you aren't willing/able read the Arch Wiki in order to actually install Arch, why would you be willing/able to read the Arch Wiki in order to set up Bluetooth or printing? 

(Although I will admit that the guides to set up printing and bluetooth were vastly easier compared to the installation guide (couple minutes compared to a couple of hours), my point is still the same. Also, there are many other things the Arch Wiki provides guides to do.)","Your arguments make sense to me. I was a manjaro fan years ago, but I eventually switched to arch because I wanted to try it. Stuck with arch for some years and when my gf wanted to try Linux, I recommended her Manjaro. End result was a total disaster. Many things went so bad, I've found myself saying ""well, usually this just works"" way too often because of something not working.. That's just not a good sign."
Linux cured me from gaming addiction,"Growing up I had a very old desktop where I could only play low end games, but this didn't stopped me from playing multiple hours a day.
As the years passed, the games I was playing started to bore me, some of them got updates that eventually I wasn't able to run properly, so i stopped gaming completely and started focusing in other things. Life was great.

Close to a year back I finally bought a new laptop, mainly because I wanted to learn programming and the old desktop was struggling even with Chrome. Initially, I was worried because I knew that now that I was finally going to be able to play better games, games that I've never played before because of my old system, it would be the end of me; I was going to start playing non-stop. And I did.

First four months were depressing, as soon as I got out of work I went directly to playing games. On the weekends, I was playing all day. My head hurt, lost interesting in other hobbies, lost friends, stopped talking to my family. I knew i had to change.
I uninstalled everything, saved my files, downloaded Linux Mint and installed it on my hard drive. Got me a few weeks to get used to it, but I got the hold of it eventually.

The urges started again, and I must admit I was weak. I managed to install League of Legends on my system. The gaming experience was so miserable, I couldn't even get stable 60 fps; somehow it was worse that my old system.
I tried to get back to Windows desperately for my dopamine rush, but I couldn't. On the screen there were error messages, something about problems with the disk's partition, it seems I did something wrong during the installation. There is no way back now.

It's been 3 months of no gaming, I'm finally whole, I'm free. Life is better, birds are chirping, the sun finally shines on my face. Linux and I are one being now, forever.","- Windows: can run LOL

linux has ruined me - a rant in several broken paragraphs,"I knew this day would come.

You know it's funny, you hear lots of mutterings about audio driver problems and so on and so forth, and yeah I've run into them, and yeah I do actually have a slight issue I haven't resolved yet where USB audio output just seems to stop until I reconnect my headset - truth be told I haven't even looked into how to fix it because it rarely happens and is not that big a nuisance...

Well I'm starting a new job, and they're migrating to Autodesk Fusion 360 and it's suite of tools from MasterCAM. They've got a training course going on right now, and asked me to attend it from home. No biggie. Right?

Shoot, no linux port.

Well, guess we'll load up windows 10 and install it, there is a reason we dual booted after all, it's been months. Get the zoom meeting link, cool.

Audio works.

Microphone.. does not work.

&#x200B;

Bros, I shit you not I've been trying to figure this fucking bullshit out now for over an hour. Do you know how many fucking different and layered menus there are for the microphone in windows 10? Volume mixer, sound mixer, new style system settings microphone settings and then old ass control panel microphone settings, app settings, configuration menu, properties menu, menus within properties within configuration within setups and app permissions and on and on and on.. nothing I've done works. At one point I had like 12 varying menus and settings windows open. It's endless. It's fucking endless.

&#x200B;

I. Just. Want. My. Microphone. To. Work.

&#x200B;

My system sounds like a fucking race car and is doing jack shit all. I have barely fucking anything installed and yet somehow windows is taking up 80gb and I had to create a symlink to another partition to install F360 in the first place because I shrunk it too far. 80gb on what?? I can't figure it out.

&#x200B;

Something that should be so damn simple is mind numbingly infuriating. Not to mention everything looks like fucking shit, text, even images are all blurry and ugly. System response is atrocious.

&#x200B;

I gave up and left the zoom meeting and windows booted back into Arch. I'll figure this out later, but I'm not being paid for this so FUCK this noise. God windows sucks. I need a shower.

&#x200B;

I'm going to go play counter-strike, where my mic works flawlessly without any set up whatsoever.

update::

Got it fixed, like most things, in general, user error, impatience, lack of sleep, trying to wing something I really shouldn't have leading to more frustration than really was proportionate to the problem.

Yup going full Linux by year 2025,"No f\*cking way I'm going to update to win11, I don't even play games that use anticheat like battleye anymore so what the f\* ever.

What distro should I go for? Thinking of Ubuntu cuz I used it before on VM

I don't have a dedicated graphics card, running a simple Ryzen 7 5700g with Vega 8 and run most of my games on ultra - medium 30 - 60 fps locked.

Games that I play the most are:

Lord of the Rings Online, DC Universe Online, Starwars The Old Republic and run PS2 emulator like PCSX2, maybe some Minecraft with friends (will I have trouble running it?)

Edit: Some fellows are recommending [https://bazzite.gg/](https://bazzite.gg/) as a gaming Distro, what you guys think?

Edit 2: Went for bazzite, besides a fatal error during installation due my bluetooth dongle, after unplugging it and doing a new install, it worked, fell in love with this distro.

Thanks everyone for the suggestions and other tips

All games above worked like a charm and all felt like they are running natively.","Regarding the distro, Ubuntu is perfectly fine to start with although the community doesn't like it very much, many users also advise Mint and Fedora as a first distro.

For gaming, install steam, lutris (epic store, emulators, wine etc.) and you'll be set. There's also gamescope that can help play some games that have visual issues.

Proton is a tool that steam uses to run windows games in Linux, you can check on ProtonDB website how well your games run. Rule of thumb is, most games work well except games with anti cheat on them. I checked the games you listed and they're gold or platinum so you're perfectly fine. See minecraft yourself: https://www.protondb.com/search?q=minecraft

Another advise from me, is that Linux migration can take some time so keep dual booting with windows for a while until you feel completely comfortable with Linux. Don't be afraid to try different distros to see which you like more out of the box.

I feel like I just had 'The Linux Experience',"I've been a casual user for over a decade, but recently I feel like I just had the 'Linux Experience' for the first time.

I was trying to use a certain app (Chiaki-ng) with x265 decoding and bluetooth audio, and it was an absolute mess. I might have been justified in just saying the app was busted, or maybe hop to another distro, but instead I:

* Compiled a custom, up-to-date kernel
* Replaced my entire audio system from pulse to pipewire
* Compiled a flakpak with custom tweaks

[Tutorial Offer] - Would anyone be interested in a tutorial on how to setup your own personal VPN for free in an AWS virtual Ubuntu server? More info in description.,"As the title says, does anyone want a Linux Noob friendly tutorial on how to setup a private VPN in Amazon Web Services on their free tier?

It would cover, AWS and EC2 instances, AWS port configuration, preparing and configuring a headless Ubuntu server, SSH, OpenVPN, DynamicDNS, vim text editor, customising bash, setting up OpenVPN clients, and some other stuff.

I'm a sysadmin and desktop support engineer by trade and I enjoy writing tutorials for people. I hate jargon and like to explain things in a straight forward way.

If people like it, I already have an idea for a second tutoiral on lxc and lxd so you can make the most of your one free EC2 server.

Edit: As /u/mdaffin pointed out. The AWS EC2 instance is offered free for 12 months. After that there is a cost of $0.0116 an hour which works out to be $8.63 a month; still cheaper than most VPN services out there and this way you have full control.

Edit 2: I am half way through writing this. I have decided to do a mini tutorial after this on installing a web interface for OpenVPN. It requires a few prereq's so it's too much to put in one tutorial, besides getting used to the terminal is always better and OpenVPN is super easy to admin. Unfortunately, I now have the pleasure of having to go and move a clients office for the next 7 hours. Hopefully I can finish it tonight, if not tomorrow! I will still keep an eye on this thread and answer questions, comments and discuss.


Edit 3: So it seems like there is a lot of interest in this and I am so excited to do it for you all! Currently I am finishing up an Office move and cursing the printer gods (seriously, who decided that printers were ever a good idea). Should be done in a few hours so will be finalising it then!

Edit4: OK 3/5 through writing it. Just need to write up about OpenVPN and NoIP (which suprisingly is the least of it...). Also need to proof read to make sure it all makes sense. I have a habbit of words of sentenses :p

**EDIT 5:** Guide is up. I'm going away for the long weekend, so it is a little rough, but good enough!!

"""user is not in the sudoers file"" error after installing Ubuntu on VirtualBox","**Disclaimer**: I am putting this here for anybody who is looking for the solution to this error when using VirtualBox for Ubuntu for the first time. I am unsure whether this was put somewhere else, so mods please delete if I am duplicating information. Thank you!

If you are receiving the error ""\[user\] is not in the sudoers file"", this means that your current, logged on user profile for your installation of Ubuntu is not able to use commands with root/sudo access. To solve this issue, type `su -` to log in as the root user. The password is the same password you used to setup the Ubuntu virtual machine.

You should now be signed in as the root user. Now, type `sudo adduser [your username] sudo` and then restart the virtual machine.

I hope this helps!","Exactly what did you install? Ubuntu desktop? server? 

Ubuntu normally has the **first** added user (made during the install process)  in the sudoers group, and does not have a root password setup so you can't log directly into root.  I believe extra users added afterwards do not have sudo rights.


So something seems wrong here."
What are your essential Linux Apps? Here's my workflow.,"Hey everyone!

Thought it would be nice to discuss the apps we use. I'm not technically a noob, because I've been using linux for over a decade. However, I'd love to know the tools you use. Here are the apps I daily drive.

I’m a lawyer and a hobby photographer. My workflow is mainly divided into four categories:

* **Work:** Research, writing, & communication (Browser, Word Processor, PDF Tweaks & IMs).
* **Entertainment:** Movies, music.
* **Reading:** Ebooks & RSS feeds.
* **Media Production:** Photo & video post-production.

Here’s what I use:

# Work

* **Browser:** Zen (in alpha but solid), and Firefox as backup.
* **Messaging:** Ferdium for WA Web and other apps.
* **Telegram Desktop:** Chatting.
* **Word Processor:** Google Docs online, LibreOffice offline. OnlyOffice when MSOffice compatibility is needed.
* **Email:** Evolution. Reliable.
* **Tasks:** Endeavour with Google Tasks sync. (Looking for alternatives with better features, better if time tracking is built-in)
* PDF Arranger: To merge/tweak PDFs.
* **Time Tracking:** Clockify. It’s okay, but not perfect. What do y'all use on linux?

# Media Production

* **Photo Processing:** Darktable.
* **Video Editing:** ShotCut. Occasionally Kdenlive.
* **Video Player:** Stremio for streaming, Celluloid for local files. (Any app that can fetch subtitles for local files of movies and shows?)

# Entertainment

* **YouTube:** FreeTube.
* **Torrent:** Qbittorrent (with search plugins—it's a beast).
* **Download Manager:** Persepolis.
* **Music:** Tauon (I have a collection of high-res music files; open to suggestions on a better player!).
* **EasyEffects:** Sound tweaking.

# Reading

* **Ebook Reader:** Foliate. (Looking for one with better customization like font editing.)
* **Ebook Library:** Calibre.
* **RSS Reader:** Newsflash. Simple and clean.

# Gnome Customization

* **Tweaks:** To fine-tune UI elements.
   * System font: Inter.
   * Shell theme: Marble.
   * Icons: Yaru.
* **Extension Manager:** For managing gnome extensions (color picker, clipboard indicator). Looking for a better clipboard app with shortcut support.
* **Ibus:** m17n for typing in my local language.

I don't really rice my desktop but would love to know good customization options. Also, a good productivity suite, even if it involves multiple apps. I need a task manager and time tracker, that syncs with Google Tasks. If it follows the GTD framework, the best.","Dude you put in allot of work in your post, I'm not going to do the same 😂😂😍

I mainly use blender and firefox"
"My kid tried to install ubuntu on his laptop, something went wrong, he is crying, and wants it all gone","Kid is 11. I am out of my depth unfortunately, but this feels like hopefully an easy revert? But that may be naive.

Lenovo laptop, bought new about two years ago, running Windows 11.

What I know right now is, about an hour ago, he decided to try to install an ubuntu partition on his external hard drive, because it would be cool (that is his explicit explanation). He's a curious kid, it's fine, I knew when I gave him the laptop that things like this might be in the cards no matter how much I urged him to come to me first before messing with the depths of the thing. No problem.

But as he describes it, it ""didn't work"" and he thought he had good instructions for how to just remove the ubuntu partition in such a case, and let windows have that drive space back and that also ""didn't work"".

Now grub loads up on the laptop whether or not the external hard drive in question is plugged in, which scares him that he's messed something up deep within the darkest depths. He can hit F12 during boot to select windows instead, and so far everything seems to work fine within Windows, but if he doesn't hit F12 it does go to grub. 

So the things he (and I) would like to see happen now if possible are:

1. The laptop itself no longer has whatever alteration to its kernel happened that makes it go to grub is undone, and
2. The partition on his external drive goes away, and becomes part of his main partition again, withot him having to reformat the entire disk losing all the apps he has on it in the windows partition

He is calming down enough that I can ask him further questions depending on what additional info you need.

In case I have given a wrong impression he is not crying and inarticulate out of some ""brattiness"" or ""stubbornness,"" he's just scared he messed up one of his most prized posessions. He was also scared I would be mad but I explained that I always hoped he'd be careful and talk to me first but also knew when I gave it to him that he's a curious kid and things like this might happen. If it is possible for this to be a non-disastrous learning experience that would be wonderful.","Luckly he used an external drive. 

The BIOS/Firmware menu/settings have an option to select what default OS it boots into, You could have it select windows by default if you wanted to.   That would be the simple fix."

Reminder - 'Beginner friendly' doesn't mean 'beginners only',"New users are often overwhelmed by the sheer number of distros available, and part of this is the misconception that 'beginner friendly' distros are ONLY for beginners - this is not true at all. Don't fall into the trap of thinking 'Mint is for beginners so it must be missing some features!'.

You can still do everything with a 'beginner friendly' distro that can with any other. 

So what does beginner friendly mean?

Usually it would mean:

- Easy install process with a simple GUI which will handle partitioning for you

- Will work on most hardware without any issues

- Most things can be done without the terminal (eg software installs, updates, settings etc)

- A good selection of bundled apps (usually Firefox, LibreOffice, a media player, file manager etc)

- Handles updates easily

None of this stops you from doing anything on your distro, and it doesn't mean you need to switch to a more 'advanced' one later on.","This should be pinned..

The funny thing is people who are asking about more advanced distros because they feel they are not beginners, noobs or whatever else haven't noticed this :)"
It seems there are a 100 posts per day asking which distro to use. Can you guys come together and help create a post that can be stickied? Is there interest in something like this? What I started with is inside.,"The goal on this is to cut down on the amount of posts asking what distro to use and to make choosing a distro a little less overwhelming.

Here is what I have written so far.  I do not think that it should be too complex as I am just hoping to give people enough info to start with Linux.  Once people get acclimated they will know better what they want and can start distro hopping.

If there is no interest then just down vote this to hell.

I figured it should not be too overwhelming and the choice should be pretty basic.  Most if not all of us go through a distro hopping phase anyway.

#What Distro Should I Use?

**My computer is old.**

* Xubuntu – This distro is just Ubuntu except it uses the XFCE desktop environment which is more light weight than Ubuntu’s stander desktop environment which is Gnome.

* Mint XFCE – If you do not want to use Ubuntu another distro to consider is the XFCE version of Mint.  Mint is based off of Ubuntu but they modify enough of the system to be considered a different distribution.  Like Xubuntu Mint XFCE also uses the XFCE desktop environment.

**My computer is modern**

* Ubuntu – This is the most popular desktop distribution.  It uses the Gnome desktop environment which is very modern looking.  Since it is the most popular it is much easier to find solutions for issues on this distro since so many people use it.

* PopOS – This distro has a more gaming oriented appeal but it works very well as an every day distro.  This is based on Ubuntu so almost any troubleshooting steps or guides you see for Ubuntu will work on this distro as well.

* Manjaro – Unlike every other distro on this list, Manjaro is not based on Ubuntu.  Instead it is based on Arch.  What makes this different is that Arch always has the latest versions of software.  This can be bad as it can cause instability when updating.  Ubuntu based operating systems usually use software which is a few versions behind but it is more stable.","There is an entire sub for the question..

What is the difference between distros?,"Hi, I'm having a problem with Ubuntu, beacuse my laptop has the Intel gpu, plus an Nvidia one. Someone has suggested me to use a thing called Bumblebee.

My gf was not impressed with linux,"I'll admit, it's been some time since I dropped into Linux, but a brand-used x250 and manjaro here I am (keyboard is aweeeesome). 

I keep trying to explain to her the layers of abstraction that exist, and how every single little function breaks down into more functions all the way down to the very very basic. It's an exercise that really makes me look at humanity differently. Anyway. 

I forced her to watch the 1982 bell labs film about Unix where Brian kernighan looks cool as fuck rocking his Tims with his feet up on that old school ass console explaining how badass Unix is, and how you can pipe commands together. 

She started to get what he was saying but said to me: ""why would I go to all that trouble typing all that stuff when I can just click the spellcheck button""

I tried to make my own similar example to show her how what worked in 1982 Unix still works. Sadly uppercase, lowercase, makewords etc don't come on manjaro xfce standard and don't appear to be in the repo (likely because basic shell manip can do that).

So I got ballsy, and tried showing her the power of sed instead. I made a bullshit file, while explaining to her vaguely that everything was a file, I typed ""touch kitties"" - and she was not astounded upon my next reflexive 'L's -m' to see the file existed in the directory. I got a little cocky, and began to show her the contents of my directory using many arguments - our hidden files tingled in sync as I threw down an ls -lAphXvlmnopqrsT

I opened vim and wowed her with all the characters pressed before any characters appeared on screen. I filled that file full of kitties this and kitties that.

And for my next trick: :wq!

She was aghast - mind completely blown. The application closed itself as if it were magic. As if it took a mere 5 character presses instead of a single click. I gloated a little about how I coulda just saved that file without permission like a fucking badass. 

At this point she's pretty wet, she's inching closer, I know she can see the sharply defined nipples of my ter-112n console font. 

I'm about to drop the most clever shit any dude has ever in the presence of a lady willing to watch a man pound away awkwardly at the terminal:

>cat kitties

The text file fills the terminal (I made sure to ^L first)

Then I did it

>cat kitties | sed -r ""s/kitties/doggos/g"" 

And here I am on reddit where I went to cozy up on the couch where I'll be sleeping tonight, and post about my endeavors.

Linux File system (Folders) in a nutshell.,"### /bin

This folder contains binaries or user executable files which are available to all users.

### /sbin

This folder contains applications that only the super or root user will need. Hence the initial S.

### /boot

This folder contains files required for starting your system.

### /home

This folder contains the users’ home directories. Under this folder, there is another directory for each user, if that particular user has a home directory.

### /dev

This folder contains files related to your device.

### /etc

This folder contains most, if not all of the system-wide configuration files.

### /lib

This folder contains shared library files used by different applications.

### /media

This folder contains all of your mounted external storage drives.

### /mnt

This folder is also like the /media folder but not used that much in modern Linux distributions.

### /tmp

This folder contains temporary files, usually saved by applications installed on your system.

### /proc

This folder acts like a virtual directory. It contains info about your computer hardware, such as the CPU, GPU, or memory. The files and folder are generated when your computer starts or is running and there are changes.

### /sys

This folder contains info about devices, drivers, and some kernel features.

### /srv

This folder contains data for servers.

### /run

This folder is a temporary file system that runs in your RAM.

### /usr

This folder contains many other subfolders binaries files, shared libraries, and other files.

### /var

This folder typically contains variable-length files such as logs which are files that register events that happen on the system.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard

"Help, I'm one of those new wave, PewDiePie inspired Linux users","So, being the all in person I am, I decided to install Linux on my 2 dead macs to get some use out of them, totally got rid of mac os and Installed Ubuntu studio, as I'm a music producer, now I'm assuming you all already can tell what kind of head-first idiot I am.
 I have 0 backups BC I don't care about my data, but I've found myself in a conundrum; I'm not, by any measure a programmer, I just thought ""hey what the hell I'll do my multi tracking through reaper"" I install reaper, open up the xy wtv file, get to a giant terminal that doesn't appear to be my main one, idk how to interact with it, I just wanna record music and now I'm learning about coding and distros, and wondering if I should've just installed mint, while having no idea how to do so.","Learning programming and linux are completely different things, no need to learn any programming.

Just wanted to let you know that you're the best. I didn't know  I needed you until I had you. Sure it was difficult to get to know you at the start since you were a closed book, probably it was this society that made you a closed book. Once I got to know you I knew you were the one and then you started opening up to me.

You were so good than my ex, do you know her name? It's Windows. She was toxic to me. She would reboot out of nowhere when I needed her the most and say that she needed some alone time and won't boot up for 4 - 5 hours.

You never do that to me and I thank you for that. You are sweet and simple and very minimal, you help me immensely and I can't thank you enough for that.

If I ever run into any problem I can fix it immediately. After years of being together, you have become just what I needed.

In the beginning, I thought you were, mind me, a bit ugly. But only those who can see through you know that you can be most beautiful In existence.

Anyway, the most important part is that every moment and every experience spent with you was immensely fun, and I'm never gonna leave you not until I die. I am glad to have found you. I can't imagine my life without you.","Linux is thicc, but have you seen the booty on Mac OS?"
Simple .bashrc tweak that I've found extremely helpful,"I'm not sure if this is common knowledge but I just added this to my ~/.bashrc earlier today and have found it very useful already:

    wiki() {
        search_term=""${1}""

    }

Then whenever you want some more info on something linux related, just type `wiki` followed by a search term in your terminal and it will bring up the entry for it on the Arch Wiki (or will display a list of results if it couldn't find an exact match). 

For example, type `wiki systemd` in your terminal and it will bring up https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd in lynx.

Luckily the Arch Wiki works great in a console browser so it's an awesome tool if you want to quickly look something up.

You'll need [lynx](http://lynx.browser.org/) or an alternative console browser for it obviously. **edit:** or just replace `lynx` with `$BROWSER`, `firefox`, `chrome`, `netscape` etc. if you want a real browser instead of console based. It will take longer to load and will open a new window but obviously the UI will be a lot better.",This is dope. Going to use this now. Thanks man!
Linux is cooking in 2025,"So, I have decided to tell Microsoft to stick their sketchy OS up their toochie. I installed Fedora KDE sorta expecting a iffy experience.

Oh boy was I proven wrong! Installing was a breeze, updating the system for the first time went without issues. It was looking good! I installed steam which had some issue of taking forever to open for the first time, but not that big of an issue. I then tried to connect my OneDrive (yeah, forced to use the silly thing) but what I found was that KDE doesn't have OneDrive sync by default, so the lovely Fedora Matrix server helped me get it up and running and it syncs both ways! To my PC and to my laptop (Which is on windows)

I was getting really excited about this so far, I was really thinking that Linux really was ready for everyone. I installed Garry's Mod expecting it to not work like the last time I tried Linux, I followed the protondb guides to get gmod working and low and behold! It worked! I could join servers!

The other game I tried which was GTA 5, worked no issues at all either!

Now, unfortunately I cannot fully ditch windows due to my reliance on adobe products and playing GTA FiveM servers (No Linux support 🥺). So I am dual booting. But I am preparing for October when I will be running a out of support OS. My hardware is fully capable of Windows 11 and my laptop runs it, however I don't want to give Microsoft what they want.

Thank you for reading my essay 😅","I wanted to mess around with something so I installed Arch as a meme. KDE Plasma sounded like a reasonable option to watch some youtube or whatever.

Ended up a week later not wanting to boot windows. And I used to vouch for it too. I even told people I love w11. I think I was turning a blind eye to all the problems that secretly bugged me. It's the best all rounder after all, right? Surely it's better than all the problems that plague linux, right?

Windows 10 vs. Linux (Manjaro) performance - AMD and Intel comparisons.,"I've already [posted some data on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/kb12or/windows_vs_linux_performance_comparison_continued/), but wanted to see if the results were AMD specific, or if they carried over to Intel too.

Operating systems:

- Windows 10 20H2 (clean install, fully updated, de-bloated).
- Linux Manjaro Xfce 5.9.11-3 (clean install, fully updated, some minor optimisations).

**Windows 10 vs. Linux Manjaro - Intel System:**

**Specs:**

- Intel i7 4500 U.
- Onboard graphics (Intel HD).
- 8 GB RAM
- NVMe OS drive.

Test | Windows | Linux | Difference
---------|----------|----------|----------
Blender CPU (lower is better) | 28:18.47 | **22:24.01** | +26.4% (Linux)
Blender GPU (lower is better)| 29:39.28 | **25:23.55** | +16.8% (Linux)
GeekBench Single (higher is better) | 755 | **797** | +5.6% (Linux)
GeekBench Multi (higher is better) | 1541 | **1695** | +4.2% (Linux)

**Windows 10 vs. Linux Manjaro - AMD System:**

**Specs:**

- AMD R5 3600.
- GTX 1070 Ti.
- 16 GB RAM.
- OS on NVMe.

Test | Windows | Linux | Difference
---------|----------|----------|----------
Blender CPU (lower is better) | 4:17.87 | **3:36.27** | +19.0% (Linux)
Blender GPU (lower is better) | 6:48.43 | **5:44.64** | +18.5% (Linux)
GeekBench Single (higher is better) | 1219 | **1298** | +6.5% (Linux)
GeekBench Multi (higher is better) | 7282 | **7779** | +6.8% (Linux)


**Conclusion:**

It's pretty obvious that either with an AMD or Intel system, Linux performs considerably better.  Gamers, and those tied to Adobe or MS Office will still wish to stick with Windows.  However, there's a strong case to be made for productivity users considering Linux, as the performance gains are subsantial!

I'm no expert at all, but I have the sensation of having been informed just about enough to be pro systemd, and even though the article says I have to make my own decision if it's good for me or not, I don't have enough information about what else systemd does and what repercussions this integration could bring to the linux world.

Also learning how to accomplish basic tasks thought the terminal it feels amazing. After I saw how shitty windows 11 looks and being finally tired of Microsoft's control over my PC I decided it was time to finally switch (that and valve committing to make games run on linux). There was no reason not to learn how to use it anymore so I went out and picked up a fresh ssd to be able to use both operating systems at once while I accustomed myself to Linux. Its been such a refreshing experience and the community is amazing, so if you like me stalked this sub for a while before finally deciding to learn it my advice is just jump in. It really isn't as scary as it looks. Pick a friendly distro (i choose manjaro cause of the game support) and just get started.","Welcome aboard.

Today I learned you can rename files with the mv command,This is probably something most experienced Linux users know but since this subreddit is for people who aren’t as experienced I thought it could be useful to some,"? 

`mv oldname newname`

I think the more important ""lesson"" to take from this is that renaming a file and moving a file are the same operation if done on the same partition...the file data isn't affected at all, only the ""handle"" to access it is moved to a different name/directory."
"They say Linux is for normal people these days, but it feels like they think ""normal people"" are all CS majors [LONG]","I have to prelude this by saying that I consider myself a generally competent end user.  I was raised in an OS-9 household and made the transition to Windows in middle school because I wanted to get in on some of that sweet Monkey Island action.  I know the install location of every program on my personal PC, I always run as Admin if the software doesn't work the first time, and I know how to google error codes and follow step-by-step instructions to make registry edits.  I don't really understand what's going on under the hood of my OS at any given time, but I am circumspect enough to do general troubleshooting.  For the most part, my computer and I get along fine.

That said, I've become more peripherally aware in the last year or so of the sort of money-grubbing bullshit Microsoft pulls (I know, I know; I'm young) and the bizarre, arbitrary restrictions they put on how users are allowed to use the OS.  The philosophy behind Linux is so comparatively enticing, even if for all practical purposes I really don't have the skills or interest to utilize the customization capabilities myself.  It's free, after all, so why not give Linux a try?  

And, I mean, I did.  But even aside from the part where I managed to destroy my laptop's hard drive doing so (long story, not Mint's fault), I've left the experiment feeling very discouraged.

The thing I keep noticing over and over is that every guide which calls itself an ""intro to Linux"" or ""Linux for normal people"" or even ""Linux for Windows users"" seems geared toward users who are prepared to do deep work tinkering the OS itself (Bash, GNU, etc) rather than use the GUI as it's given.  Most of these guides start off with how to navigate the directory through the terminal, FFS.  I know it's a valuable skill to have, but I care a lot more about first learning to navigate the directory from the *desktop.*  

I do not do network administration or development or coding.  Neither am I the sort of user who only checks their email and browses the internet.  I have a few particular programs I use very frequently (Manga Studio, MusicBee, Scrivener, a handful of non-AAA games) and my goal is to be able to continue to use them; I'm a simple woman.  I understand how the path through the Windows directory works, and I know how installation ties into that - you find a location in Program Files [(x86)] and there you put your executable and all related files, probably with a shortcut to the desktop.  If you want to keep backups for the save files of a game, find the default or custom location for those files and store them on an external drive or the cloud.  It comes very naturally after so many years using a PC.  Finding a simple but thorough ""compare and contrast"" introductory guide, however, one which uses Windows as a practical reference point for understanding Linux (""you're used to having a C: drive, but Linux doesn't use that.  Instead, we have the root directory..."") has been surprisingly difficult.  I know that trying to understand one OS as a variation on the other isn't how you come to really comprehend how it works, but it would make me feel much steadier on my feet starting out.  It seems to me that those more foundational skills should come later.

Stupidly simple example question: Linux doesn't use .exe files, so does it have a direct equivalent?  Is there a default install location for software a la Program Files? If not, what does it do upon installing a new program instead?  How the heck does the whole process work?  And why am I struggling to find an easy-to-understand answer to this question?

I don't know.  If you've made it this far into my long whine, you may be thinking that if the only reason I'm interested in moving to Linux is to make a statement, then it's really not for me, and that may very well be right.  I suppose I just wish that the community didn't keep throwing out the line that Linux is for everybody these days, and then begin every stable distro's introductory guide with how to navigate your files without a mouse.  Of course, if I have any fundamental misunderstandings about this, please say so.  I really am interested -- just overwhelmed.  Thanks for reading.

EDIT: I really appreciate the feedback from everyone here.  I haven't had a chance to respond to every post, but I'm reading all of it.  You're all so encouraging!","> I would love to find an easy-to-understand guide to what's happening when you use Wine to run an .exe.

Running an executable on Windows isn't much different from running an executable under Linux. The language of an executable is specific to the processor, not the operating system.

Trouble is, the executables do need the operating systems' help to do anything useful, like writing to the screen or reading a file. Most programs don't know how to read a file – they instead go to the great library of functions and ask for help there.

In the Windows world, this means going to `CoolLibrary.dll` and using its `open_a_file_please()` function.  
In the Linux world, this means going to `freeLibrary.so` and using its `get_a_file_for_me()` function.

So what does Wine do? It starts `Program.exe` in such a way that it can intercept its visits to the library. When `Program.exe` goes to `CoolLibrary.dll`, Wine assumes the role of CoolLibrary. The program then asks for `open_a_file_please()` and Wine says – no problem, right on my way.

Wine knows that `open_a_file_please()` corresponds to `get_a_file_for_me()` and translates everything so that `freeLibrary.so` can take over. After `freeLibrary.so` did its thing, Wine will translate whatever came back so that it makes sense to `Program.exe`.

So, Wine squeezes itself between an .EXE and the Linux environment, and translates what happens on the interface between program and operating system.

Does that make sense to you?"
Just created my first executable shell script and I'm weirdly proud of myself,"I'm new to Linux and have 0 experience with programming, but I researched and managed to make a super simple script to set a sleep timer. Here's what I came up with;

    read x

For some reason, I couldn’t ever get it to work after hours of tinkering and debugging. 

Then, I remembered I had an old laptop with a lubuntu image on it that I haven’t used in months, and made explicitly for situations like this. 

Installing everything I needed was easy, and doing the assignment itself wasn’t that easy, but at least I could actually DO the assignment. Everything just worked out of he box without too much setup.

This is like my 23th attempt to make the definitive switch to linux and I'm doing everything I can to make this one right.

My laptop now runs Linux Mint XFCE with no issues, but my desktop was always the problem and the main reason I switched back to windows so many times.

https://preview.redd.it/5gfjeih56wvc1.png?width=697&format=png&auto=webp&s=7edb4e404cf2e06db9a6a38de38f2e5966aca4ce

So, in the past weeks I've had **a lot** of problems with linux mint, some of which I didn't find an explanation online, like:

* Random sound cuts
* PC unusable when installing games or heavy HDD work happened.
* Desktop randomly signing out my session
* Sometimes not having monitor signal
* Random youtube framedrops

I tried Linux Mint Cinnamon, Linux Mint Debian Edition, Linux Mint XFCE, Fedora (both gnome and KDE), Ubuntu, Arch (btw) and in every distro those problems were present sooner or later, at some point I thought that maybe was an Xorg or Wayland issue, later I considered maybe a pulseaudio/pipewire or alsa thing so I tried them all. And, the funny thing is, nothing of that happened on Windows, so the answer was pretty obvious... or was it?

I was ready to give up once again, but after seeing Microsoft's plan to push even more the ""suggestions"" and ads on Windows, I tried to stick on linux and try to learn why all those problems were present to fix them.... just to fail epically soon after.

Anyway, after an update which contained some kernel stuff, my pc started to show a couple of messages regarding  USB issues, messages that weren't there before.

Things about some usb ports not starting correctly, so I read some sites and a lot of those problem were related to some BIOS configuration and faulty or damaged usb ports. Then I remembered one of my front usb ports didn't work well for a long time (I don't really use the front ports for some reasons). So I revisited the BIOS, saw that everything was fine, the problem was still there.

So I unplugged everything, started to check all my usb ports one by one, all of the back ones were perfectly fine, but one of the front seemed damaged, so I unplugged the front ports from the motherboard to see if that fixed anything.

And well... all seem to work now.

No USB issues, not random sound cuts nor video cuts, not system slowdowns, it looks like just.... it just works.

I know more issues will rise as I'll use this everyday (like tha fact that cinnamon for some reason decides to force my keyboard to english and don't show me ""Latinamerican spanish"" as an option, just ""spanish""), but I don't know what could have happen if I just switched back to windows and ignored that hardware issue.

Linux forced me to read, to learn and to fix something that could potentially made a bigger problem in the future.

  
Update: Well, the video/audio cuts are still present, but that's the only issue right now and a very little small price to pay.

I've been playing GTA IV and the cut itself is much smaller than a second, is noticeable because of the audio cut, but it doesn't affect the gameplay, and it's weird, it can happen after 20 seconds or after 20 minutes, it doesn't matter if I'm playing something heavy or just watching some random video on youtube.

But that aside, I'm feeling very confortable with the system and it stays.","Firstly Never apologise for writing in a completely different language that’s not your native tongue.

Want to learn how Linux works and the commands to use the command line effectively in your day-to-day? I'm putting out a tutorial series on just that.,"Hey guys,

first of all, let me introduce myself. My name is Mislav Jurić and I'm a recent computer science master's degree graduate. I am interested in AI, tech startups and software engineering.

I first started using Linux on my computer about 2 years ago and I'm still using it. Albeit I have used Linux for 2 years, for the first year and a half I was using Linux mostly through GUI and everything I didn't understand I would Google. Googling stuff is OK, I've got nothing against it, but I didn't have the foundational knowledge of how Linux actually worked under the hood. I didn't know what the commands in the tutorial I found on Google were doing to my operating system.

When I started working as a software engineer (there I also used Linux), I decided it was time for me to learn how Linux works and the basic commands that would be very useful to know. I read three books for that purpose:

* Barrett, D. J. (2016). *Linux pocket guide* (3rd ed.). O’Reilly Media.
* Shotts, W. (2019). *The Linux Command Line, Fifth Internet Edition*. Retrieved from [http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php)
* Ward, B. (2014). *How Linux Works: What Every Superuser Should Know* (2nd ed.). No Starch Press.

After reading those books, I had the knowledge of the foundational concepts of the Linux operating system. I am by no means an expert, but I think I know the basics.

I thought to myself: ""Hey, there are probably people out there dealing with this situation as well."". So I made a Linux Tutorial Series primarily aimed at people completely new to Linux and for software engineers who have never used Linux before. You can find it [here](http://www.mislavjuric.com/category/linux-tutorial-series/). I've got both written and video version of it (video resides on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAiVTP4ez4s&list=PLyscv5D4FoIi1CU_HsV1j1QPafNSlY0dJ)). The tutorial series has some videos where I explain fundamental operating system concepts. I think that in order to understand Linux well, you need to understand the basics of how operating systems work. If you're a software engineer, you can glance over those parts, but for people that haven't got a computer science background... Well, you're in for a treat!

As I said, I don't deem myself an expert in Linux. For that reason, I created [Linux Stories](http://www.mislavjuric.com/category/linux-stories/), which is a podcast where I bring in guests who have been using Linux for longer than me. It's a supplement to the Linux Tutorial Series and it's there if people ever want to go farther than the Linux Tutorial Series will take them. ([YouTube link to Linux Stories playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRXCaArl8WE&list=PLyscv5D4FoIi5D6sXURtDnW4y75nhr8nv)). I also post some content unrelated to Linux, such as a podcast around AI, startups and software engineering called [Interesting Conversations with Mislav Jurić](http://www.mislavjuric.com/category/interesting-conversations-with-mislav-juric/). This is my personal brand, so I'm putting out content related to everything I'm interested in.

I am present on various social media platforms, as you can see from [my website](http://www.mislavjuric.com/).  Feel free to follow me on any social media platform you find convenient. My preference is YouTube and my newsletter. Although I've never sent out a newsletter before, I want to do it only when I have something juicy and interesting, such as a really cool podcast episode or a very thoughtfully written blog post. Don't worry about getting thousands of boring emails - I hate that too.

I hope you find this useful!

Best,  
Mislav","6 months is more than enough to learn the CLI and how to use it effectively. Knowing everything, on the other hand, is impossible. And he admits multiple times he does not."
I'm losing it with linux,"I'm really struggling to adapt to using linux. I started work in a new field this year (computational chemistry) and was told by everyone in my office that I shouldn't use windows, that I should switch to linux. I asked which distro and was told to use Ubuntu unanimously by everyone in the office. Since I'm working from home, and my pc is on Windows 10, I've been using Ubuntu 20.04 on a Hyper-V VM.

The problem I've having is that I'm supposed to be getting work done, but instead I spend hours battling my OS and troubleshooting. Things that I assume should be simple such as installing a program take me hours or days to figure out. There's about 50 different ways of installing programs on linux and I can never know which one is correct for the program I'm currently installing/trying to use. Of course any info when I google the problem the info is years out of date and doesn't work anymore. Not to mention everyone always assumes you have at least some rudimentary knowledge of how linux works. So I end up spending hours trying to learn how linux works, instead of just using linux to do my work.

I'm extremely frustrated and losing my head, I found myself screaming at my computer which I've never done before in my life. Every single thing I want to do requires me googling it, spending ages reading outdated askubuntu pages, then ending up asking a new question on askubuntu and just hoping someone helps me out (which I would appreciate tremendously), which just doesn't happen, 6 questions asked over the past few months and no answers. And then when I ask a question and try move on to solving some other issue I have, askubuntu tells me I have to wait 40mins between asking questions. So I'm using these 40mins to blow off some steam and have a rant here.

Not sure what to do other than power through this learning period. Thanks for reading my rant.

tl;dr I'm spending more time battling my OS than using it.","While there are some people who would disagree with this, but there is no shame to use windows. I see the OS as a tool, and you need to use the tool you are the most productive with. I would recommend doing the work the way you are most productive with and continue to experiment inside a VM when you have the time. When you start to feel comfortable in the VM then you can start to transition your work away from windows and into linux.

Its true that there are some good advantages of Linux over windows, but no advantage matters if you are struggling to use it.

I have found that the best way to learn linux is to break it. Use the VM and just experiment. Try to install programs through the different ways. If there is something that you don’t like, just use the VM to roll it back and try something different. Dive into the configs and try to customize it to work better for you. When you break the OS, you can roll it back and now you know what not to do. I learned so much more by taking risks and failing then trying to find a single perfect answer on google. Once you start to understand how linux works, it gets a lot easier to troubleshoot problems. Just a warning, if you plan on experimenting, be careful not to use any paid licenses that you could possibly lose."
Don't run this in terminal,"This is today's ""Linux command of the day""

You may have seen this command

Edit: I forgot to say, this is called a ""fork bomb""

    :(){ :|:& };:

And you may wonder what it does. Here's a breakdown.

First things first, while this does make your computer freeze, it's not permanent. Everything is happening in your memory.

:() <-- This creates a function called :

{ :|:& } <-- This recursively calls the function in the background. Since it's in the background, it never terminates, so it takes up all of your memory.

;: <-- starts the process

Pretty much, you make a function that doubles itself every single time it's called. The first call makes two, then those 2 make 2 more, etc.

Since none get terminated, it takes up all your ram, and you have no choice but to restart your computer, because nothing is going to respond. Just power off your computer, since it'll be really hard to power it off from the terminal, or the button on your GUI.",">windows vista install

>made the system unbootable

The fork bomb did you a massive favor"
Trying out Arch Linux because of Pewdiepie...,"Yes. We all know it. We have seen the video.

But personally for me. Me and my friend has been thinking about trying out Linux for a very long time now, it's just that we didn't care enough to actually try it out. But then after Felix built his first PC, he installed Linux Mint on that thing and Arch Linux on his laptop and saw how cool it is to customize your own desktop and everything and I thought maybe I should try it out. I mean there is nothing to lose if I try it out.

Now I know that Linux Mint is RECOMMENDED for beginners trying out Linux, but for me, I really wanted to try out Arch Linux no matter how hard it is. I'm planning on Dual-booting it with my old extra HDD that's installed in my PC (I have 2 other SSDs btw), I just don't know how to do it.

=====

EDIT: WIth all things considered. I decided to go with what the comments say. I'll try out Linux Mint first because that's what Felix did before moving to Arch Linux and see where I go from there. Still worried about the Dual Booting though.

=====

EDIT 2: I have successfully installed Linux into my old spare HDD with ease. Create a Flash Media or something like then flash it using balenaEtcher, then Live Boot off of that, then from there you can choose to try it out or install directly there. If you did choose to install it from Live Boot, it's a pretty straightforward proccess, it's like installing a program from Windows, just be careful which drive you mount your Linux from. It also downloads GRUB for you so Dual-Booting is already solved.","""I really wanted to try out Arch Linux no matter how hard it is""

Ok, but a few things to think about before you progress. Firstly, don't come back in a few weeks complaining about how nothing works and Linux sucks. It's one thing to want to learn something challenging but too many people think they're so clever and then blame the system when stuff doesn't work. Don't do that.

I also want to make sure that it's Arch you want and not just Hyprland. You can run Hyprland on any reasonably up to date distro - it doesn't have to be Arch. I run it on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. I'd recommend picking something like Fedora or Tumbleweed and trying Hyprland with those.

Next, make sure that you have a good reason for picking Arch. A lot of people pick it because of the reputation but don't even understand why you choose Arch over other distros. I switched over to Linux a year and half ago and tried Arch but it was more of a headache than it was worth for me because I didn't need super cutting/bleeding edge packages. Tumbleweed works for me because it's rolling, pretty up to date, but far more reliable. Make sure you actually know what's different before you go all in on Arch.

Finally, you have come to a forum asking for help to create an install media. What that shows is you haven't been able to Google ""Arch Linux"" and follow the instructions on the website. You also don't know what a virtual machine is or why you may want to test there first. Your level of computer knowledge is pretty limited. This isn't to call you out or gatekeep but you also need to know what you're walking into. Arch is designed for people who will troubleshoot their own problems and read the extensive literature. If you have to ask basic questions, you should not be using Arch.

I love that you're inspired to use Linux and that's a great thing. But going into Arch will give you a negative experience. I'm not being an asshole by trying to tell you that. Please try something else first, understand the basics of what Linux even is, then go to Arch when you're more confident. Otherwise you'll just end up another person crying that Linux sucks or the community is mean."

Why is ubuntu the most popular distro and has been for a while?,"From lurking ive seen that distros such as zorin os and mint are reccomended much more than Ubuntu for beginners, and power users don't tend to go for it. So why is Ubuntu still the most popular distro?","Ubuntu was the first Linux distro that had a great hardware detection and was instalable for a not tech savy person (like me).  

Ubuntu was intended for people from developing countries, to close the ""digital gap"" - ie to be installed on literal garbage (thrown away laptops) from someone without any technical education above being literate - to enable those people to go online, educate themselves and better their lives.    


Today, there are many more distros, that are similarly simple, but back in the day, Ubuntu was special - and that has echos for today."
How can I convince my dad to let me install Linux on *my* Laptop?,"I've been making my life as private as possible during the summer holidays; I've degoogled, reduced my browsers fingerprint, ""hardened"" firefox a bit, and am mostly using FOSS (except for my OS). The only thing there's left to do is to switch to a privacy respecting OS.

There are no apps that I use daily that wont run Linux. I'm also pretty comfortable with the command line. So, I'm pretty much ready to make the switch, but my dad wont let me do it! My parents are kinda strict and wont let me do stuff without asking them first.

Help pls

# a HUGE thank you to EVERYONE!! My dad has finally let me do it, as long as I don't go complaining to him if I mess my something up!!! 

^((and my laptop has only 4GB RAM, so switching to Linux will give me a way smoother experience than windows, I think))",Just make a complete backup image of your windows first. That way they know if something goes wrong you can go back like nothing happened.
"Did you already know, that you can play many Windows-Games from steam on linux with Steam's ""Proton""-Tool?","I didn't know it until a few months ago. 

I read about it in a popular german computer-magazine called ""C't"" a few months ago and I was really surprised!  
Because until then, I thought I could only install/play games on steam which are also supported for linux.

Now I can play some other, in reality for windows released games!  And that's really nice :3

For those, who would like to try it and don't know how:

Go into your steam-library and right-click your game in the list. Go into the settings/properties of the game and there should be a point like ""compatibility"". Maybe you will have to check steam play ... but then there should be somewhere a point ""proton"". There you can choose ""proton experimental"" or other proton versions. 

The best thing is, that you can check here, what the experiences of others users with different linux operating systems are:

Thinking of switching? Tips from a user of 26 years.,"I see lots of posts here from people considering switching to Linux. As someone who has used Linux exclusively since '98 I think I'm qualified to list a few pointers:

1. Don't think that you can convert overnight. If your computer is important or is used for critical tasks either use a different one for your initial Linux adventures or at least make backups and install Linux on a separate partition.

2. Don't make it harder than it has to be. I'd bet the majority of people that end up going back to their old OS do so because they made Linux harder than necessary for themselves.

3. Don't try to do it all at once. Just get comfortable with the way Linux works for a start. It's totally different to Windows under the hood but it's also transparent so you can see how it works. Read about it, snoop the filesystem, get familiar with it. Don't worry too much about radical customization or learning 15 programming languages until you feel at home.

4. Don't use a particular distro because it's what the ""cool kids"" use or because it's the flavour of the month. I'm looking at you Arch, and all your bastard offspring. Use a mainstream, mature distro that uses a mainstream, mature packaging system. These kinds of distros also tend to have better forum support. Don't bother replying in defence of Arch or any other niche distros, I don't care what you think.

5. There's nothing worse than a distro that works fine until you go to upgrade or install new software, when you find it craps out because of missing packages or a dependency or an offline repository. Or maybe the repo is up but hasn't been updated. In my not-at-all-humble opinion you should only be considering distros that are either Debian or Red Hat based. The Debian based ones include Ubuntu, Mint, MX and others. The best known RedHat based distro is Fedora. Personally I have always found the Debian distros to be rock solid with zillions of available packages, and the apt based installers to be extremely reliable. With Mint or MX you don't normally have to enable any extra repositories.

6. My recommended choice for a newby is always Mint. Debian based, reliable and solid, very good hardware detection, huge repositories and solid package management. It requires little to no fettling out of the box. MX is also very good and is a little snappier.

7. Don't get sucked into using the fanciest whiz-bang desktop environment you can find for your first installation. Just get something simple like XFCE, Mate or maybe Gnome for a start. Get the feel for Linux first, then you can spend as much time as you like customizing the ultimate desktop.

8. Don't ask for help on Reddit (yes, I know). Go to the forum of your chosen distro, you'll get better advice there. This place is full of snot nosed kids. Google any problems you might encounter; it's almost certain others have had the same problem and have found solutions. I'm gobsmacked by the quantity of questions asked here by people who have obviously spent zero effort on even the most rudimentary web search. Helping yourself is easy.

9. Linux distros are almost trivially easy to download and install. Most can be run from a USB stick. The beauty of this is that you can see if you like a distro and check its hardware detection without having to install it (known as running a live session). If you like it you can generally install it from within a live session. A handy source of info on many many distros is the distrowatch web site. There are lots of info there on many different distros but remember point 4: avoid the obscure distros.

10. For the first few months at least, treat your Linux partition as experimental. In other words don't use it to store important stuff. Sometimes the first distro you try doesn't quite do everything you want so don't be shy about trying something different. Besides it's fun to see how other distros do things. When you are satisfied with your distro and desktop environment then you can make it your everyday workhorse.

That'll do for now.","Good post.  I’d add, before you actually install Linux make a list of the programs you use in Windows and see if Linux versions exist or if similar programs exist so you can have a conversion plan.   I also took notes on all the tweaks I had to do to get something to work so it was easy to reproduce after a rebuild (and I did a lot of rebuilds).  I used the web version of OneNote so the notes were available over rebuilds. Use a password manager like Bitwarden so you always have access to your passwords across rebuilds.  Finally, I got a Firefox account so my bookmarks would synch so every time I did a rebuild I had all my links to the pages with a solution to issue I had to overcome.  For example, I had to figure out how to get xbindkeys to work so, once I figured it out I wrote  down the h file info so it would be easy to set up the next time."
Happy new year Linux-ers,"I know this is not a good place to say happy new year but I wanted to share happiness with y'all. Been a year using linux from Ubuntu->Manjaro->Arch (hopping).
Peace out!",Happy New Year's to y'all as well.
Resolved my first Linux ticket!,"I’m a long time lurker in this sub and just wanted to say a quick thank you to everyone who posts here!

Tldr: Working in IT support (Windows), RHEL server P1 came in on Friday afternoon, no Linux guys around. Manager gave me a shot at it. Resolved!

So I’ve been working in IT support for a couple of years (entirely Windows based) and just started on a 2nd line team. 
This Friday my manager got a call from another team panicking that a client’s app was down and all their Linux guys were either sick or on leave and did he know anyone who could help. 

He knew that I’d been learning Linux so sent  them to me.

After a few minutes getting credentials sorted, and suddenly I’m loose on a prod Red Hat app server 😅
Thankfully the Linux guys had documented the crap out of things and I was able to locate and restart the borked service pretty quickly. 

Needless to say, both managers were really happy and said I’m going to be getting more Linux tickets coming my way from now on 😊

I know it was only a simple thing but I’d never have gotten to this point without the help and advice posted here and the other *nix boards.

So once again, thanks, you guys are awesome!",Props to the Linux guys documenting everything. It's for scenarios like this you document your environment. Make sure your manager knows and send them your compliments. And kudos to you for fixing the issue!
Why is there so much hate for Ubuntu?,"Everywhere I look online, Ubuntu gets so much hate. I see it called things like ""Fisher Price Linux"" and ""Linux for babies"", and often people recommend anything besides Ubuntu. Often when someone has a question about how to do something on Ubuntu people just recommend they get a ""better"" distro.

So, what's with the hate?","People don’t like Canonical’s opinionated experiments that were never upstreamed. Red Hat upstreams their experiments. That’s why we have systemd, GNOME, and Flatpak instead of upstart, Unity, and snapd on most distros."
Is Linux for everyone or just for programmers?,"I know we linux people wants everyone to adopt this OS. But are we really helping people?
I am seeing people suggesting who are new to linux. Suggesting to open up terminal or read the wiki.
If that's the case linux will never be mainstream desktop OS. You just don't tell a new guy to jump into terminal.
I surely wouldn't want my grandma to use terminal.

Modern linux distro can be used without the terminal and reading the wiki. If someone wants help and he is new. Maybe point out the GUI option first.
Appreciate the GUI. I don't why people think by dissing GUI they will become some PRO.

If you want ""Linux for Everyone"" to works. Than you need to explain people like a people not a programmer.

This ia just my two cents.","Here's the reason that the ""Open a terminal and type this command"" answers to questions are so common: simplicity and universality.

If you have a question about Windows (or any GUI), look at the typical answers given: they are long, drawn out with multiple screenshots to illustrate what you should be seeing. Often they'll have a video because it's easier to show a GUI in action than to describe the step by step clicking that you need to do. Now, it's so much more complicated with Linux because there are so many different Desktop Environments and an infinite number of ways to configure them. This makes extremely difficult (if not virtually impossible) to describe to someone a click-by-click GUI method of fixing a lot of problems.

Conversely, most Linux issues can be easily solved by a few fairly universal terminal commands. These commands can be cut and paste into the terminal quickly with very little extra explaination; no long drawn out video or explaination necessary. Most terminal commands are Desktop Environment agnostic and will work regardless of the GUI setup. 

A good example is installing software and a PPA in Ubuntu and its derivatives: It's much easier to give a couple of apt commands to add the repository, update the sources cache, and install the software. Explaining the GUI method would be tremendously complex and differ greatly from Gnome to Cinnamon to KDE so much as to be useless."
Useful software nobody told you about,"Hello all

I recently found a piece of software that is just perfect for its use - that nobody had ever told me about. Do you have any little apps like this that improve the system or do something incredibly useful? 

I'm not talking about things like Firefox, Gimp, or a text editor - but apps that one may not find in a typical ""50 apps you need for Linux"" article. 

I guess I'll go first:

The app is ""tuptime"" it displays the total system uptime, average uptime, current uptime. Also downtime! Basically neofetch or ""uptime"" on steroids. 

The second app I have been using for a while is ""syncthing"" which allows you to sync a directory/folder between devices with just a few clicks in the web-gui.","Pushd and Popd, didn't learn these two commands until about 7 years into Linux. Great commands to know.

Why Linux so hard?,"I am a long Windows user and I am tired of constant restarts, freezes and other software related issues. After watching a lot of encouraging youtube videos claiming Linux novadays works flawlessly and is so user friendly, I decided to give it a try.

I have a quite modern Thinkpad and I’ve chosen Fedora KDE. Booted it up from USB stick. It looks nice, but I started having issues from the very beginning.

1. ~~Opened YouTube. No sound.~~
2. ~~5g WiFi doesn’t work. No error, no internet. Regular WiFi works.~~
3. ~~Date is in US format. Changed all regional settings to my country. It still shows time in US format in the taskbar.~~
4. ~~Tried playing movie from network drive- codec is missing. Copied command to install codec from Fedora official docs- command didn’t even run. Error about some unrecognised parameter. Somebody on Reddit suggested installing VLC through flatpak. I’ve done that, still same codec error.~~

I spent like 30 minutes trying to figure those out without any luck. I have some experience with Linux running vps and a home server, but this is just too much. Am I doing this wrong? Or maybe I am just too weak for linux.

EDIT:

Didn't expect so many comments, thanks to everyone trying to be helpful and encouraging. Almost all the initial problems were resolved by simply installing Fedora to hard drive instead of running from USB.

Lockscreen date shows wrong format only on the initial login and it doesn't bother me at all. Codec issue resolved by replacing flatpak VLC to dnf and installing additional codecs.

Couldn't get KIO GDrive working, installed rclone instead. rclone is a bit complicated to install, required setting google api, rclone itself and systemd service to run in background. But at least it seems to be working fine.

Then my Windows rdc files did not work. Figured out krdc doesn't support domain prefixed usernames, then also had to adjust Color depth and Acceleration to fix the broken image. BUT after adjusting all the settings it looks great.

So my conclusion after using Fedora for a couple of days it is actually really great, but it requires investing some time to configure and get used to. It feels a lot snappier and cleaner than Windows. I really like all the options to customize KDE. It doesn't have any of my Windows complains (maybe just yet) - sleep/weak up works great, no force restarts, multiple monitors and docking works great, no slowness.","The harder you Linux, the stronger you become."
Linux is better than my expectations.,"Last month I switched to Ubuntu.

"A tip for noobs - stop doing what ""AI"" suggests without checking other sources.","Hi noobs - that's not an insult, we were all noobs at one point:

I have seen dozens of comments here and on forums where a noob uses some AI bot to get instructions to do something, then their next action is to post in a panic because they wiped their drive or can't boot anymore.

Just don't try and use AI for Linux, **just don't.** The current ""AI"" is just word salad. It takes your words, looks for words to go with them that seem to make sense, then spits them out. IMO the ""I"" in AI is a misnomer. ""Artificial Word Generator"" would be a more correct title.

There are literally **100's** of websites, forums, chat rooms, and even this place here, where you can get solid, respectable, and mostly correct advice from humans with *actual experience* using Linux. I think all, or at least nearly all, distros have a forum somewhere, so start there.

    alias test='command1;command2;command3'

now save by pressing ctrl+0, don't change the name and ctrl+x to exit.

now whenever you type test, command will be executed! (reopen the terminal)

The bashrc file can also be used for more customization, you can use figlet or lolcat or something to have fun!

Forgot which distro I am using. It's for the better,"I switched to linux a while back both on personal and work front to save my computer from becoming a piece of junk. A new guy joined the office today and he turns out to be a linux enthusiast. Asked me my distro. I told him, I do not know. I forgot it. I installed it and then it has worked for me ever since without any problems. I totally forgot I was using a different OS at all. By the way, thanks to the people at linuxfornoobs for recommding me great distros back then. Anyways, it got to me thinking, I use it for everyday, at home and at work, and  forgoting I was using something different from before is a good thing. Sure, it took me a few days to get accustomed to the new DE but since then it has been a smooth sailing; in the end it gets the job done and saved my computer. For that I thanks the whole linux community. Not linux or apple or windows fanboy.

I have officially made Linux my primary operating system.,"Hey everybody,

I’m new to this Linux community after making a switch from Windows 10 to Linux Mint (Cinnamon).  I have a nine year old desktop that came with Windows 10. 

Here are the specifications for that machine,

Hard Drive Type: Mechanical Hard Drive
Number of Cores: Quad-core
Processor Brand: AMD CPU
Graphics Processor: AMD GPU
Drive Capacity: 1 TB
Installed Memory: 4 GB

I realized over the past few years it has gotten slow, sluggish, and just terrible performance overall. Therefore,  I started to troubleshoot my PC. I discovered that there were no viruses or malware. However, I did find some adware that I managed to get rid of. But, that didn’t resolve the issue my PC was still slow. I did find out that there were a lot of bloatware running in the background according to Windows Task Manager.

With my experience in electronics, I began examining the hardware. Everything appeared to look and operate okay, however, it was just a little dusty. I got rid of all the dust. After doing everything that I could to fix my PC nothing seemed to work. With windows 10 becoming obsolete, I thought about throwing my machine away. But, I had a second thought. 

I said to myself “What if I switch to Linux?”. Because I heard about Linux reviving old laptops and desktops, So, I started researching about which Linux distribution is best for a newbie like myself. I concluded that Linux mint was the best distribution in my personal opinion because it’s intuitive and easy to navigate through for someone who is new to Linux. 

I’m happy I made the switch from Windows 10 to Linux mint! My PC is much faster and smooth. I discovered Linux mint uses less system resources and is highly secure. I just wanted to share with you guys my satisfaction with Linux.",Mint is a great choice for a first Linux experience.
A Clean Cheat Sheet to 491 Linux Commands,"I created a comprehensive Linux commands cheat sheet, covering a wide range of commands. [https://linux-commands.labex.io/](https://linux-commands.labex.io/)

By the way, most commands can be practiced online. 😂

[Preview](https://preview.redd.it/y9igi5bvsc4e1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b43c24858e5355e4ef00e35e9c2573a0ec9331da)","I don't think it's a good idea to list obsolete commands.

For example, ifconfig was replaced by the iproute2 package quite some time ago. Some distributions no longer offer ifconfig via the official package sources so that the tool cannot be installed at a later time.

In the same way, telnet, for example, should no longer be used at all (e.g. because passwords are transmitted in plain text). You should at least add a note here."
My 10 year old nephew is interested in Linux. What are child-friendly ways of teaching him?,"He always used to watch me when im on my laptop. So every now and then i let him type a few commands and run some scripts, he seemed to get the hang of it.


I decided to give him an old laptop with Pop OS on it because he loves games. I know there are several command line games that help teach how to navigate and use linux in general, are there any suggestions you guys might have?","https://linuxjourney.com will help you teach him the command line and some things that are useful to Linux. Since you are using Pop!_OS for your son, skip the section on /var/log and teach him how to use the systemd journal via `man journalctl`. If you would like, teach him about shell scripting basics to convert his knowledge into scripts."
"Welp, I did it. I finally fucking did it Reddit. It took 10 years of using Ubuntu, the last 3 on this sub, but I ran rm -rf * on my home directory. Please help me.","Its an SSD.  About 15 seconds into realizing what happened I pulled the power cord because I know every second of  continued use would overwrite my files.  I havnt turned it back on since.  I have live boot USB's.  I'm posting this from my phone.  I havnt googled solutions yet, I'm posting here first thing.  Trying not to freak out.","I think it's implied that you don't have backups, so:

1. Go buy an external drive now.  It must be larger than the partition you're trying to recover.
2. Boot from your live USB media.
3. Connect the backup drive to the system.
4. Use dd to copy the entire partition to a file on the backup drive:  ""dd if=/dev/sda4 of=/mnt/usb/myhomepartition"" or ""dd if=/dev/mapper/VolGroup-home of=/mnt/usb/myhomepartition""
5. Install testdisk within the live USB environment, and use that to try to recover your data: ""testdisk /mnt/usb/myhomepartition""

Repeat steps 4 and 5 if you damage the image of your partition.

When you're done, schedule backups.  If you want to keep them on the removable drive, put a repeating item on your calendar.  This isn't a great system, since it's vulnerable to theft or loss, bad sectors on the removable drive, and forgetfulness.  It's better than nothing.  Otherwise, look up an online service like rsync.net."
Another reason I love Linux...,"For decades I used Windows but was horrified by what I saw coming in Windows 11. I switched to Linux a few years ago and I'm loving it (now using Tumbleweed). I'm getting older (early 60s) and I realize another thing I love is that with Linux I have to keep a lot more things in my head compared to Windows. Turns out this is a great daily workout for my brain and helps keep me sharp. I've got those things pretty much memorized cuz I have to use them every day or every week or so. And occasionally I find new things I need to memorize.

With that being said, I am hoping that more and more Linux tasks get pulled out of the CLI and get put into nice GUI apps. That way even more noobs like me can easily jump to Linux and hit the ground running.",">I'm getting older (early 60s) and I realize another thing I love is that with Linux I have to keep a lot more things in my head compared to Windows. Turns out this is a great daily workout for my brain and helps keep me sharp.

LOL!  Linux is a good way to keep an old guy's mind active -- problem solving always is -- but I'm not convinced that ""make geezers remember more stuff"" is *necessarily* a design goal or selling point.

I'm 77 and have been using Windows and Linux in parallel on side-by-side computers for close to two decades.  I want the operating systems I use to work to be as ""no fuss, no muss, no thrills, no chills"" as possible -- stay out of my way and let me focus on the document I'm writing or whatever I'm working on at the moment.  I use Ubuntu as my workhorse because Ubuntu, which has served me well over the years, does that for the most part.

But I do appreciate your point.

During COVID, a group of retired friends, all of us in our 70's, got bored out of our minds and started a ""distro of the month club"".  We pick a distribution every month or so, install it bare metal on test machines, use it for three weeks, and then compare notes about the distribution, evaluating the distribution in general and in terms of our own use case.  Over the last few years, we've looked at several dozen distributions.

I've enjoyed exploring the variety of design approaches to Linux exhibited by the different distributions, but I've become very aware of how quirky many of the distributions actually are, and how difficult it can be to get any given distribution to ""no fuss, no muss, no thrills, no chills"" state, and keep it in that state.

Yesterday, I spent a few hours installing LMDE, setting it up for my use case.  As distributions go, LMDE (LM wedded to a Debian base as a possible future rebase of LM from Ubuntu) was easy to install and more-or-less ""no fuss, no muss"", but I ran into all sorts of minor glitches (for example, getting the mouse to stop twitching running Red Alert 2 on Steam) that I'll probably be able to resolve over the weekend.  I'm sure that I'll run into other stuff as I start using LMDE in earnest over the next few weeks.  Not a big deal, but typical.

I would very much like to see at least the ""*ordinary-user-oriented""* distributions become entirely GUI and reasonably mindless.  To my mind, we can do that without abandoning more complex design approaches for Linux users who want a more complex working environment.  Linux isn't a monolith."
I didn't think it was possible.,"I used Ubuntu back around 2008-2011. Life happened, ended up doing the Windows thing for years. With W11 coming up and just feeling kind of tired of the way I have interacted with technology, I decided to give Linux another try. One caveat: games. I will get to that.

Doing some research and deciding to dive back into the somewhat familiar, I installed the latest Ubuntu and the latest Fedora Desktop on a multiboot USB and took them for a spin. A lot has changed with Ubuntu, some stuff I like, other things, not so much. Gnome has really changed, too. I used it on Fedora for an afternoon and at the end of that session, liking the feel and look of the distribution, went, ""fuck it"".

This morning, I installed Fedora on my main drive, completely wiping the WIndows 10 install previously housed in it. After install, I ended up applying updates, and then... I decided to install Steam.  I have read about Proton and how far this has come. I have pretty aggressive system specs (or so I think, see below). I knew what I was getting into.

I followed directions on one website to get Proton working and decided to install Cyberpunk 2077 from scratch. I have been playing this game since launch so I am quite familiar with it. I waited for it to finish downloading and when I got the notice that the game was ready to launch, I thought to myself, ""no fucking way this is going to work..."". I am running an AMD GPU, no additional drivers needed or so I read, with an AMD CPU. This means that other than installing Steam, enabling Proton, and installing the game I did no tweaking--as barebones as it gets.

I launch the game.

Not a glitch. Not one fucking glitch. I played for a bit. Had a virtual meeting. Came back to the game. No issues. Whatsoever.

I still need to get my RGB fans and all that sorted out and I need to move my Steam library over to another drive (any guides on this?). As far as I am concerned, this is the end of the road for Windows on my personal devices. Good riddance.

TL;DR: If you think it isn't possible, try. You may surprise yourself.

My specs:

* Processor: AMD® Ryzen 5 3600 6-core processor × 12
* Graphics: AMD® Radeon rx 5700 xt
* Memory: 16 GiB
* OS Name: Fedora 34 (Workstation Edition)
* Gnome version; 40.1.0
* Windowing System: Wayland","Try OpenRGB or CKYMD.

You can't move steam drives. You have to reinstall(may be wrong though).

P.S.

If you set an external drive as a steam library, make sure to edit fstab to auto mount it on system boot. Other wise Steam won't detect it.

I do this by enabling it in Gnome-disks and setting mount point to /mnt/nameODrive"
Shoutout to BROTHER - Printer company with Linux support,"Just wanted to share a positive experience. As the support for Windows 7 is running out, all my family admin PCs get now the Linux treatment - If anybody is going to Windows 10 they are on their own, or need to get a different ""administrator"".

So I sometimes get some old and cheap consumer hardware to support. One was a Brother DCP-195C a several year old printer/scanner and as ""consumer"" as one gets. Unluckily it is not supported via the kernel... So I had to install the driver manually. Which was a breeze:

* Searching for the model on the [support website](https://support.brother.com/g/b/productsearch.aspx?c=gb&lang=en&content=dl)
* Selecting ""Linux"" as OS and chosing between .deb and .rpm
* And here I just got the script ""Driver Install Tool""
* Starting the script with the model name as parameter
* (Pressing enter 5 times) - Done 

That was near to a Windows experience! Also what I liked is that there is also the option to individually get different drivers for the printer and scanner (in 32bit/64bit). So if something works well enough with the kernel drivers, one could choose only the missing.

I was really impressed to find that support for a 6 year old, 100 buck cheapo device from the next electronic retailer...","Arch has many Brother drivers in the AUR and for Gentoo there is the brother-overlay, meaning we don't even have to work around the package manager.

Also, while for every device there is a driver package, they only have a few actual generic drivers. The individual packages just contain the correct driver branded for actual device. I found that out when there was no package for my mother's printer in the brother-overlay and I started poking around in it.

I even managed to print from a Raspberry Pi, using the 32bit driver with qemu-user. Was really slow but it worked.

Too bad their drivers arent FOSS, though :/"
My Friend Switched to Fedora. Here's How it Went.,"I decided to turn my friend on to Fedora 36 WS a bit ago because her experience with Windows 10 was beginning to cripple her laptop with bloatware, random stuff running in the background, intrusive updates, etc. Her SSD was also totally full, and we decided a full wipe wouldn't hurt considering it wasn't full of anything useful. So we proceeded. First, the good:

* She loved GNOME. I know a big portion of talk on here about Linux DEs surrounds how familiar Windows users will be with them, but her transition to GNOME was flawless & she really enjoyed using it because she preferred it aesthetically to Windows.
* GNOME Software, despite its bugs, was great. She agrees that downloading installers from websites is clunky, & having a package manager was great. I remember my first experience using a Package Manager, and thinking, ""Why doesn't everyone else do it this way?""
* Everything worked perfectly, no system slowness, no bugs, nothing went catastrophically wrong. Every app she wanted to use except one (Roblox, unavailable on Linux) was a smooth experience.
* Minecraft ran far better. Kind of an aside, but cool nonetheless.

Now, the bad:

* She never once updated. Everything was out of date because she was never FORCED to update, so she never did. I know the more technologically inclined among us may see the gentle update system on Linux as respectful & superior, but I think this is something to think about.
* Nobody around her uses Linux, & she can't just call a company for support. She can't ask anyone but me if she has any issues. Despite my urging that she probably won't have any problems, I understand the looming idea that *something* might happen is important to think about.
* Roblox. Enough to tip her over the edge to switch back to Windows 10. Grapejuice & WINE are not seamless enough with the average user to be considered as a solution, and for the life of me I cannot even get it to work.
* Multiple versions of packages in the store are confusing. Say what you will about Flatpak, but Flathub apps are updated regularly (when the user updates them :P) & distro-agnostic, and personally I consider Flatpak package management to be pretty newb-friendly.
* She has a 4k laptop display connected to a 1080p monitor. Sometimes there were weird situations moving windows back and forth that caused things to act unexpectedly. I think this is a more well-known issue.

I can't say there's a takeaway, but she's switching back to Windows 10 in spite of the knowledge that her Linux experience was faster, smoother, seamless, & low-maintenance. Maybe Fedora was the wrong choice for a beginner, but I thought it worked out well enough. I think if the Linux world is going to create a real newb-focused distro, we will have to make some concessions & implement features that we ourselves may not enjoy using in the slightest. Like forced updates, or stripping the Software Center of different kinds of packages. But that's just me, I am uncertain what others think & you guys may have a different take.

Although I feel discouraged, I understand that there were a lot of wins here & Linux is VERY close to being 100% beginner-friendly. I'd give the experience a B+ in the end. We are very close to an A!","I've observed the update problem with users as well (even with Windows users, now that it has apparently relaxed its requirements a little) and it's problematic. I don't really see a way around it other than scripting a forced update weekly, or something similar."
"Finally Switched to Linux, Best choice ever made.","Windows was slow and annoying. I had to reinstall almost every month. Now I am an Manjaro user. Everything works as intended, If not better.",You had to reinstall windows every month? Sounds like bullshit or a serious user error. I've been on the same win 10 for 5 years.
How many of you that are students use Linux as a daily driver?,"I am willing to use Linux because of the fact that I like it and feel comfortable using it, but compatibility could be one of the factors that I worry about, how could I get around that? Is there really any significant difference in compatibility speaking of education tools?",LibreOffice can present some compatibility problems but it does give the option of saving and exporting files in different formats
Just switched to Linux for the first time ever! Why am I so tired,"After lots of reading and hesitation, with very little computer knowledge for an engineering student, I finally decided to just do it. I saved my few important files onto a USB, burned Mint onto a different USB, booted my laptop from that, and installed it, erasing everything else on the disk and hopefully scrubbing my computer of those Microsoft germs forever.

It wasn’t super hard and only took a few hours, but why was that so exhausting? Anyone else feel like the whole learning process really takes a lot of energy out of you? Felt like after a long run, but now with eye strain.

Anyway mostly just posting cuz I’m proud. Excited to learn more stuff soon.

Edit: Thank you to everyone for the warm welcome! Posts on Reddit can be intimidating but y’all’s coolness and support totally rocks.","Sounds like you're tired because you dove headfirst and are learning as you go, so your brain is being used up to the max. As you get more familiar with Linux, your brain won't work as hard trying to memorize new shortcuts and commands. Welcome to Linux! Hope you enjoy."
"Pro Linux Tip: Don’t choose a distro out of public opinion, thinking it will make you look “cool”.","*Linux is Linux* The only differences are the philosophy and the package manager.

I use ~~Gentoo~~ Fedora for ~~control~~ Simplicity, and control. I feel like I have the right to own my PC rather than be given something preconfigured like Windows, Ubuntu. Im too much of a coward to write my own os using assembly and C.

If you like Ubuntu, that’s fine. If you prefer Mint, that’s fine too. If you’re a nooby, and you choose Arch, find it too hard, switch back to Ubuntu, and everything works that’s fine.

I hate how people treat Linux distros like they’re military branches or a fashion statement.

Anything is good; they’re all the same—except for Open and FreeBSD, which are totally different.

If you want to explore different distributions, that’s fine, but don’t feel like you have to use a specific Linux distribution just because everyone else does. I understand if a distribution has a larger community with more support, or if your current OS doesn’t have software or packages you need.

*”But what is the best distro for gaming!”* I can get 90 Minimum Minimum, 95 average to 115 High FPS in Read Dead Redemption 2 on Ultra on my ~~Gentoo~~ Fedora, **just download your drivers.**

Another pro tip, if you’re a gamer AMD drivers are recommended, if you have a NVIDIA Driver- here’s an an analogy.

Linux is the parent, AMD is the golden child who gets everything right, and Nvidia is the rebellious stepchild always causing problems, but too smart to kick out.

However, jokes aside, it’s like buying designer clothing just because everyone else is doing it; that’s a poor choice. Use what you want.","Pro tip : if you think choosing a distro over another makes you ""cool"", get friends."
Any way to obtain a bootable Linux USB without internet?,"Basically I have loads of parental controls on my devices and I want to get around them. My windows pc is controlled by my foster parents and I can’t go on any website they haven’t manually approved and everything I do go on gets sent to their phones and they can see everything. 

I was thinking if there’s some way to create a Linux bootable usb stick then I could boot to that and then I could use that when I want some privacy. 

The thing is website like Ubuntu aren’t going to be approved and I’m worried that if I ask for them to be approved they’ll know what I’m going to do. 

After Christmas holiday I might be able to use a school computer to create one. But before I do all this, would it even work?

Edit:

My phone is going to lock itself due to the parent controls in about 5 minutes. Thank you everyone for the advice I’ll be back on tomorrow","If they've done their job correctly you won't be able to access the BIOS without a password. Reboot your machine and see if you can get into BIOS. If not, you will need to come up with another plan that involves different hardware."
Been using Linux for 5 years now. I am still a noob and I have no idea whether this is normal,"I've been using Linux for 5 years but I am still at such a starting point.

For everything else I need to Google.","You are a developper, you should know better than anyone that we always search for commands (even the basics). it's pretty normal, our brains don't have unlimited memory."

I remember when I first tried to learn about virtualization I felt kind of overwhelmed by the amount of information, technical terms and cross references which constantly made me jump around between sources.

I focused on building a basic understanding step by step for complete noobs.
You should be able to read it from A to Z without googling anything or look up definitions. 
Basically no previous knowledge is necessary what so ever, you should know how to use Linux, for example open up a terminal, create a directory etc.

**[Virtualization #0 – A boot camp for newbies \(QEMU+KVM\)](http://www.catchlinux.com/virtualization-bootcamp-for-newbies)**","this is pretty cool. I use virtualbox for all my virtualization needs, are there any advantages of using kvm+qemu over virtualbox? While we are at it are you familiar with vga pass through and do you have a tutorial on how to do it?"
I found a GREAT linux tutorial website,"[https://www.computerhope.com/unix.htm#commands](https://www.computerhope.com/unix.htm#commands)

This is so far the best guide into linux commands I've seen",Also check out[ Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/)
I did a day's work in Linux as a Windows System Administrator!,"So I've been trying to get away from Windows for about a couple months.  Been doing the distro/DE hopping thing.  I learned a lot about Linux installing and using Arch as my daily driver at home.

I settled on Pop!_OS because I will be buying a laptop from S76 and they seemed to be very stable and easy to use (even for someone who came from Arch).

I can now use it as my personal daily, but I wanted to see if I can work as a System Administrator in a mostly Windows shop (though we have other tech like VMWare and NetApp).  However, I didn't want to join the domain with Pop!_OS.  I found out I could do almost everything.

1. Remmina helps a lot with RDP duties.  However, if you need to access outside the organization (going through RDGW and RDCB), Remmina is not very happy with that.  I just can't connect at all this way.  Even when trying to use the resulting RDP file from the RD Web portal.

2. NetApp and VMWare are all administered via the web browser, so all is good in that land.  I even used Microsoft Edge to separate my work bookmarks from my personal stuff in Firefox.  Even VMWare's Remote Console is available for Debian based distros (DEB file), so it was easy to install via Eddy.  I can't imaging what I have to go through with Arch and AUR.

3. DisplayLink - I have 4 monitors at work.  3 supported by the docking station, so the 4th monitor have to use a USB3 to DisplayLink adapter.  I couldn't get it working on Arch, but Pop!_OS just needed me to download and install the DisplayLink driver from their website.  It was specifically for Debian or Ubuntu-based distros with easy instructions.

4. Having to rely on Outlook sucks, but their online version isn't too bad.  One Drive isn't automated since I just use the web version.  I'm not interested in syncing folders right now.

5. Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and RingCentral - we use these for communication, and all 3 has Linux-specific apps.  Zoom and Teams were already in Pop Shop (and also in most distro package manager), but RingCentral I had to download from the website (also installs easy).  Again, not sure if I could have made it work in Arch.

6. I also found that our central firewall management software has a native Linux version (Java-based).  It feels clunkier than the Windows version (which already feels clunky), but it worked.

7. Printing - much harder than I thought.  Gnome seem to just display everything that's on the network, so i had a hard time finding the right printer to set up.  After many trial and error, I found it and made it my default printer.

8. I'm tasked to edit a large PDF file (adding or removing pages), and in Windows, I use PDF Rider (and FoxIt Reader to add some small amount of text).  I found FoxIt Reader to be available for Linux as well (had to download from site, not found in Pop Shop), but there are so many PDF editing software that lets you delete, move, and replace PDF pages I literally just chose the top one and it worked great!

I booted into Pop!_OS and figured if I ran into any I can just go into Windows, but the entire day I was just finding Linux alternatives to do my job.  I was productive, and I was excited it was done in Linux.

Update: wow I didn't think this post would get this much attention, lol.  Thanks for the wholesome awards! ❤️","That's seriously impressive. I've been using Linux for years and what you did in a day I did half of in 6-8 months.

I've been using Linux on and off for about 2 years now, so I'm not exactly a noob, but I'm not experienced either. I started with Ubuntu, and now I'm using Arch. The install was easy for the most part, but the real issues came afterwards.

So I boot up the system and then notice that the internet is a bit slower than usual. So then I go online and look for the exact driver I needed which took a bit. Then I opened Steam to install games and noticed that it and only it was slower than everything else. So I looked for a few hours until I found an obscure reddit post with like 3 upvotes from 3 years ago that fixed my problem. Okay, so then I go to play my games, and they don't work. So I look online for how to get them to work and hear about all of these obscure launch options. So I go to install these, put in the launch options, and sometimes they work. Sometimes. Other times they don't. Sometimes they have anti cheat that doesn't work on Linux. To play them I'd have to set up either a VM or a dualboot, both of which are a lot of trouble to set up. Maybe I'll just be fine without them. Then there was an issue with bluetooth, so I had to install something and go through a convoluted process to get it all set up.

You see what I mean here? I really want to love Linux, but every little thing I do comes with a convoluted process that adds on and on until it really isn't worth it anymore. I sometimes spend significantly more time setting things up than actually doing them. I don't like Windows, but at least with that you can just install it and it works. I've heard people say that Linux is more stable than Windows, but I've never had a single crash on Windows, and have had many on Linux. Every time it crashes I have to look through journalctl and find an error that might have caused my problem, and search it up only to find nothing on it. I really like Linux, but I don't want an OS to become my hobby. Sometimes I just need it to just work without tinkering. I wish that I liked using it as much as Windows because I don't like proprietary software. I'm all for free and open source solutions, but I don't think it's ready for my use case yet. I say all of this with no ill feelings towards Linux or its community, but I just don't know if I can do it anymore.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for the advice! I tried a few distros, and after testing most of them I ended up going with Debian. After a while of using it, I can say that I love it. It took some getting used to for sure, but I think it is a good middle ground between Arch and Ubuntu. Not too easy, not too hard. I'm really glad that everyone here (whether you gave me recommendations on what to do or just called me dumb, which is honestly deserved) for giving me the advice that I needed, and for helping me. I was honestly super close to switching back to Windows out of frustration, but I'm so glad I didn't.","If you want my advice, don't use Arch. Use Ubuntu."
Finally installed Linux for the first in Life!!,"Migrated to Linux today @ 5am in the morning. Wasted too much in backing up files from before installation on a bs sd card. But finally done with installation. I have installed Pop_OS! and it just took 30minutes to migrate. Linux is the best! Everything works fine. Wifi, bluetooth,sounds etc. Please guide me further to freedom.

How can i start from here? I migrated for privacy and comparatively proper performace of my pc and light gaming.","Welcome to the community. 

There's a few recommendations to get you up and running. I'm only going to list the essentials to keep it simple and to the point. The rest you can pick up a long the way and you can ask if you need help with anything else post setup.

* First thing to do is to update the system and packages. To update the system using the terminal do `sudo apt update`. `apt` is the package manager of Ubuntu/Pop OS deritives. Other distributions use different package managers such as `pacman`, `zypper`,  and `dnf`. The process is almost the same, except `apt` would be substituted with the corresponding package manager on other distros. You may wish to update the system using the software update centre/manager if you prefer.

* I would install `gnome-tweaks` which will allow you to minimize/maximize the windows in Pop OS. By default its usually disabled and requires this extension. 

* Install the proprietary NVIDIA driver if you use an NVIDIA card. I believe Pop OS has it pre-installed, however it is useful for other distros where you may need to install it manually. If using AMD, these aren't needed as the drivers are in the kernel.

* For Steam gaming, enable Proton via Settings>Steam Play>Enable Steam Play. This is the compatibility layer which will allow you to play many Windows games under Linux. Check [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/) to check how well a game runs. Not all games work, but the number is increasing.


Other than that, I'd say just get farmiliar with using the system, install the apps you need (you may have to download open source alternatives for some) and enjoy the journey. Feel free to ask any questions and good luck :)."
I can't believe how much it was weighing my computer down,"For months I thought my computer was at its end. I was running Windows 10 and it was taking ages to boot up, not just to the log in screen but to actually load up a program once it ""started up"". Multi-tasking had become a joke and for some strange reason loading the first website after starting either Chrome or Firefox always took longer than subsequent loads. It just felt so ""heavy"" and everything seemed like it was just barely chugging along.

This computer is around 5 to 6 years old, its technology is probably older -- i5 4th gen, 4 GB of RAM, NVIDIA GT 740M. I figured it was breaking down and decided to start looking for a new one. In the process, I figured since I'd be replacing this one soon, I'd just install Lubuntu (being a lightweight distro and all) to see if things would be any different. I had zero expectations anything would change. I figured everything was a hardware problem.

And holy cow was I completely wrong. This thing works like its brand new! I can finally do multiple things at once. I can finally run some of those heavy applications that took ages to load on Windows 10; they now load in seconds on Lubuntu! I thought I'd have driver issues but nope, everything worked right out of the box! And I'm not sure if I can't recall correctly or whether this is actually happening but it feels like my Internet's a lot faster on Linux too. I'm pretty sure my download speeds are much higher than normal.

I have seriously reconsidered getting a new computer because it certainly feels like I already have one. I cannot believe Windows 10 was weighing it down so much. For a long time, I've hesitated making a complete switch to Linux but I think this is it. I might miss Microsoft Office, but I'll learn how to make the most of Libre Office and the Google Suite.

I know all of this sounds absurd and it probably sounds like I've discovered a new religion or something but I'm so glad I won't have to spend hundreds of dollars on a new machine and I can just enjoy this one for some time more.",You’ll probably see the exact same thing if you reinstall windows. That being said Linux is the right choice 😉
A Great Tool for Distro Hoppers - Use Ventoy!,"I've been using Linux almost exclusively for about 4 years now - gaming has long been my exception until more recently. In all that time, whenever I wanted to try a new distribution or install Linux on a new machine, I'd often go digging around for a USB drive, format it because I couldn't remember which ISO I already had on there, toss an ISO on it, and then start installing.

This year, I discovered Ventoy. If you're not familiar with it, then I want to make sure you know about it. Basically, if you put Ventoy on a USB drive, you can then add multiple ISOs. Now every time you use the USB drive to start up an install (or run a live instance), Ventoy's UI shows up instead and allows you to choose which ISO you'd like to use. Now I just have one labeled USB drive with a dozen ISOs for whatever I need it for.

I am not involved or associated with Ventoy in any way. I just think it's an awesome product. Simple, sure. But game-changing for me. Hopefully this helps someone else out there.  


[https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html)","I would like to add that ""adding more `.iso`s"" is literally just copypasting the `.iso`s, no flashing. Also, in the `.iso`s partition you can also store whatever (documents, videos, images, etc) and they are accesible and writable."
Just a friendly PSA to remind you not to run meme commands.,"If you see a command outside of a support situation DO NOT run it without researching the command first, if you already know what it does then make the judgement based on your knowledge but if you are unaware of what a command does don’t run it.

Experiences of a Microsoft Developer moving to Linux,"I am a full time Microsoft Dynamics & .NET developer working at a famous Redmond company ;)

Over the last month I decided to try to use Linux as my full time driver for work on my laptop, I tried the following distros  Debian, Ubuntu (Pop, Budgie), Deepin.

Out of them I think Pop OS is the most promising for the MS development work I do (Have not yet tried Fedora)

Personally I enjoyed working on linux, learned so many new things and feel it has come 80% close to replacing windows for me at work. From personal use perspective its definetly a full 100% and I think its a better alternative than windows in a lot of areas like customization etc.

To make me feel at home with the UI, (Gnome is awesome btw) I used dash to panel, Arc Menu, Minimalistic calendar from gnome extension store. This will make Pop OS (or any gnome desktop) look exactly like Windows 10.

I developed 2 github repos while using Linux for Linux with dotnetcore and visual studio code, very good experience, just like in windows 10, check them out below

[https://github.com/sudipmandal/deepin-ext-cal-sync](https://github.com/sudipmandal/deepin-ext-cal-sync)

[https://github.com/sudipmandal/any-os-wallpaper-cli](https://github.com/sudipmandal/any-os-wallpaper-cli)

However there are still things which made me run to my windows machine, Visual Studio for windows workflows development WWF (Dynamics custom workflow) (Mono did not work), Lots of custom non dotnet core tools etc (Wine did not work for them)

Here is a list I compiled for Microsoft Developers who want to give Linux a try but want a picture of what they might be getting into (List compiled with softwares running on POP OS 20.04)

https://preview.redd.it/b5365i5i9g251.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=8851a5819834c7b90a0663dbdf953fac53d12f1f

**Final Thoughts :** For Microsoft developers windows is the best option especially with WSL, however for personal machines where you might not want to spend on a windows license, Linux is definetely a good option even for Microsoft development if you are willing to spend time configuring everything. It is certainly more capable now than it was a few years ago.

**UPDATE :**

1. I would like to make clear I am not trying to advertise Windows over Linux, I just want to raise awareness to Microsoft & Windows developers about how Linux is a good alternative to Windows... Yes for us MS devs windows is the best OS for work but that does not mean its perfect ... (dont get me started on windows update etc... it sucks).... This post is intended at enthusiastic windows developers to try out Linux and help them adopt Linux for work. I am sure if the correct developers take note of my points, we can make the above list fully green.
2. Yes I know how to use a VM and have run Windows OS run as guest on linux, I have mentioned it on the chart above in the last row, and it works great as any other OS on a VM, no complains, however VM is kind of not the point of this post, in order for us Microsoft citizen developers to get the best experience we need native app support from MS just like they did with Teams, hopefully my post draws some attention and MS or some other developer fill in these  gaps for us.
3. Yes Onedrive works on Linux, however Microsoft has been unfair with it as the Linux client requires approval from a Office 365 admin, this is not required on Windows client. I think it is because the onedrive client apps are actually 3rd party apps and are not release by Microsoft, Really hope this is fixed soon by MS.
4. Lastly I think FOSS and Linux are the future, Microsoft is doing the right thing by now focusing on cross platform and open source (VS Code, DotNetCore, Typescript just to name a few). We Microsoft citizen developers should follow lead and make Linux an equally great platform for us.","Reads kinda corporate doesn't it? If W10 is required for work, familiar, and the UI absolutely has to look the same...stick with W10?

IDK. I appreciate that Linux _isn't_ just a W10 clone or lookalike...isn't that one of the main points?"
High schools switching to Linux,Hey I’m writing a sr thesis and my point is why schools should switch to Linux but all I can think of is positive I need some counter arguments. And any good pros If you got some,Software compatibility issues and users not being familiar with the interface and linux in general which complicates things for new people.
It's surprisingly satisfying to be able to fix a problem from the command-line in emergency mode without looking up what to do.,"Posting this just to express how unexpectedly pleased I'm feeling at not having to resort to my usual trick of booting from a USB stick or another distro on a different partition to look up the solution on the internet and use the tools in *that* distro to fix it.


It's probably of no interest to anyone else, but I'm going to post this here anyway.


Today I installed a new distro onto a spare partition on my SSD, resizing the partition in the process (I'd originally made the partitions unnecessarily large).


That went fine, it all worked great.


But then I rebooted and selected my normal distro from grub... and failure.


Not the end of the world, I'd backed up my drives immediately before installing the new distro (which always seems the sensible thing to do), plus I had the new distro and a bootable Puppy-Linux USB and my phone as lifelines with which to seek a solution.


But for the time-being I decided to pretend I didn't have all that to fall back on. So, how do I fix this?


To cut a long story short (and leaving out a lot of useless stumbling around with only the vaguest idea of what I was doing) it occurred to me that something similar had happened to me before when I'd replaced my HDD with a bigger one, and the system failed to boot properly because it was trying to mount a drive that wasn't there.


Could changing the partition have had the same effect?


I remembered that I'd had to edit fstab to get the new drive mounted in place of the last one. So *where* was fstab?


After a bit of looking around I eventually found it.


I decided I didn't want to mess things up *too* badly in case this didn't work, so:


    mv fstab.old fstab.older
    cp fstab fstab.old


But how to edit it? I don't know how to use vi or emacs. Wait! I vaguely remembered that one of the pages I'd looked up when I first edited fstab had suggested using nano. Worth a try:


    nano fstab


It worked!


After a brief experience of ""Oh crap, I deleted the wrong line. How do I exit without saving?"" I managed to comment-out the line for mounting that partition then save-and-exit.


Next step:


    reboot


When I'd tried that before trying to edit fstab I just ended up with it doing a file system check before exiting into emergency mode again.


This time however, it worked!


Problem solved all on my own without looking up the answers or falling back on booting from a different distro to use the tools in that distro to fix it.


I feel so proud of myself. Like a five year-old feeling proud of themselves for managing to color-in the picture without going outside the lines.


It might not be impressive to anyone else, but it's a personal milestone that I've managed to pass.","Nice!

ELI5 why everyone hates `systemd`?,"Seems a lot of people have varying strong opinions on it one way or another. As someone who's deep diving linux for the last 2-3 months properly as part of my daily driver, why do people seem to hate it?","Systemd is an Init (Initialization), this type of program is the one that manages all system and user processes to start, stop and even plays a crucial role in controlling the resource usage on your PC.

Inits are started right after the kernel is started when you turn on your PC. They are extremely important for the system.

Many users complain that Systemd does not follow the Unix philosophy of ""Do one thing, and do it well"". Instead of being a set of small, modular tools that interact with each other, Systemd is a monolithic system that encompasses multiple functions beyond system initialization (*init*), such as service management, logging (*journald*), device management (*udevd*), networking (*networkd*), and more. This makes it more complex, interdependent and difficult to debug or replace with individual components, which goes against the minimalist and modular approach of Unix.

Other Init like OpenRC, s6 or Runit are more modular and smaller, maybe even **faster** than Systemd but they are not as established as Systemd or not as compatible at the moment.

Personally I don't care, Systemd works and I don't have the slightest intention to change it as I don't see the point in doing so. Why would you change something manually that works and on top of that most popular distributions are built with Systemd in mind?"
More poeple switching to Linux?,"I don't know if it's just me and my algorithm, but I think that lately (in the past 1 or 2 months) the number of people asking questions in order to switch to Linux has been increasing a lot.

Is just me or someone else has notice this?","Microsoft aren't doing themselves any favours with their current updates, and yeah I'm noticing more users dabbling in linux."
I feel less nerdy after I switched to Linux,"Am I the only one who feels like I'm using less time fiddling with stuff on my computer after I switched away from Windows?

When I was using Windows, I was always messing with settings and stuff to get it to work better, both system settings and settings in the AV or whatever other programs I had installed. After I've started using Linux , I feel like I use a lot less time fiddling with the operating system on a day to day basis. As a result, I don't feel as nerdy about my PC anymore. I used to feel like a power user using Windows, because I felt I needed to be to get the system to run properly. With Linux I'm not a power user, and I don't feel the need to be - I feel comfortable that it's running fine as it is, for some reason.

Anybody else have similar experiences?","Funny, it was the opposite for me. I had to do a lot of messing around once I installed Ubuntu to get it working the way I wanted. I guess it depends on what you're using it for, and what distro."
How come programs on Linux install themselves in different places?,"Lutris is in usr/games, zoom is in opt/zoom, icecast is in etc/icecast, and terraria is in /home/user/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Terraria.

Why are they all in completely different directories, as opposed to one singular location?","Programs should normally be in /usr/bin/. Apparently your distro (Ubuntu?) keeps a seperation between games and non-games.

Zoom is an optional package - not in the core repos, so it goes into 'opt' for the added optional things.

Icecast will probably be in /usr/bin/.  You can confirm by typing `whereis icecast`, and find which one of those is the binary by typing `which icecast`.  /etc/icecast is just the config files.

Steam doesn't want its programs accessible to all users - just the one who installed the program - so it's kept in the user's home folder.

AFAIK it really should be in ~/.local/bin/steam, so that's Steam's fault for making a mess.

In general, if you're hunting for a program, start with 

> apropos vim

... and you'll see programs related to that thing. Once you have what you want, you can use:

> whereis vim

... and you'll get all the configs and such.  To locate where the actual program is:

> which vim"

"Learned the hard way - document everything, guys...","If i had to give some advice to people, who start using Linux - document everything.

What I mean is - write down every change you make, every package you install, every step you perform. That's because sometimes - what a suprise - you don't know, what you don't know! And when something breaks, or bad happen, you can at least have a reference to the steps you did earlier.

It works the other way, too - if you want to recreate some steps on the other hardware, you can just open your notes and follow your instructions.

It is maybe 5 minutes more per new task, but man - it pays dividends! And you learn along the way.

What makes linux better than windows?,"I use windows, but thinking about switching to linux. So what is so special about linux?","I've done tech support for years, and that means Windows when I'm out in the wild.

I don't know about ""special"", but I will say that I like Linux because it's not always wanting something from me. I install Linux and get it configured how I like, and except for an update every couple of weeks, I can go about my business. I reboot far less than on a Windows machine. I find it. . .peaceful. Also, I feel like my computer is *mine*.

After more than 15 years of using only Linux on all of my home office computers, I was forced to buy a Windows computer for someone else in the household, and for something that couldn't be gotten around any other way. It's always squawking about something. Check this, reset that, what seems to be never ending notifications about unimportant things, constant squawking for attention. I'm not amused. I don't feel any need to return to Windows like 'a lost sheep'.

When this Windows laptop ages out of its OS, I will be delighted to turn it into a Linux computer.

One way Linux seems to be vastly superior to Windows,"Since switching to Linux, I've been a little disappointed in the experience, mostly because I didn't properly understand what to expect.

One area I've found where Linux absolutely smashes my Windows experience is in sorting files. On the desktop, if I change how the files in a directory are sorted, Linux takes second to rearrange them, Windows would take several minutes, on the same drive with the same files.

Maybe the difference is because I didn't have Windows configured properly, though I made sure to turn indexing on. Still, it seems Linux has that particular feature nailed.",Vastly superior that Linux never recommended to me to install Candy Crush.
"Using Linux Mint for Gaming for 6 months - The Good, Bad, and Ugly","Hey been using Linux Mint for some time and thought I'd throw some pro's and con's out there, mostly gaming related but with a few other notable things.   
If you are on Linux and run into any issues related to the below send me a message. Otherwise I hope it helps you decide if you haven't switched.

**The Good**

* Absolutely no issues when installing Linux on its own hard drive
* Steam works flawlessly with the majority of games, maybe 20% needed launch options that can be found on protondb, the other 5% needed a little more work
* Hardware worked out the box, I didn't have to install drivers manually like I expected
* Not having bloatware is a huge positive, the whole OS just works faster
* Updates can be done much quicker and easier than windows

**The Bad**

* NTFS hard drives can be used, but I had to manually mount them in the terminal so I could access the games on steam, a lot of those games then didn't work when running off that hard drive. They can be moved over to your main drive easily though through steam, making migrating from windows fairly easy.
* ~~Discord screen sharing is a problem, I had to use a custom client (vencord) and install pipewire (Mint uses pulseaudio) otherwise your stream won't pick up sound~~. (Edit: They have now added audio to screen sharing) You also don't get badges on the taskbar (the red dot) like you do on windows
* RTX doesn't work on Hitman 3, probably not on other games
* Sometimes a game may not start and I'd need to add launch options, takes 30 seconds if you go to the ProtonDB website
* Installing mods may require extra launch options (e.g. beppinEx for Lethal Company) which can take a bit more time to find while your friends wait for you (i.e. abuse you for not using windows)
* Age of Empires worked fine until I tried multiplayer and kept de-syncing, required some troubleshooting and ended up downloading a random .dll file from the internet.
* Epic games didn't work for me, there is a client called Heroic Games Launcher that is supposed to help by integrating Wine, but when I tried to use it with EU4 it didn't work (the only game I tried)
* ~~If your program crashes, force quitting can become a pain. On Windows I could use task manager to keep my programs in line, on Linux I believe you need to use terminal commands. Sometimes a program leaking memory like my 90 year old grandma would make me just restart the PC.~~ (System Monitor does the same thing as task manager) ^(thanks /u/Tagracat )

**The Ugly**

* The Adobe suite doesn't work on Linux, alternative FOSS software people talk about are not replacements if you use this software heavily. 
* Virtual Reality is a hot mess and is not going to support Linux any time soon, SteamVR worked but splurged errors everywhere, it also crashed every time I started Beatsaber, desktop view didn't work, front camera didn't work. I use an original HTC vive and apparently that is one of the few headsets supported on Linux (it's not) This is the only thing stopping me leaving windows behind forever.

**The TLDR**

* Steam good
* Epic games not good
* ~~Discord is rough around the edges~~
* Adobe apps bad
* Virtual Reality will save windows

Thanks for listening to my TED talk.","This is a pretty solid estimate of the state of things. 


 I rarely have driver/hardware issues either, but those that do show up a lot in support forums so it gives the sense that hardware is a big problem in Linux, where it is more accurate to say hardware can be a problem in Linux.





Adobe has always hated Linux. Thier software is expensive and often pirated, a Linux release would be cracked and spread across the net like wildfire within hours, I don't see thier stance changing anytime soon."
Using Linux at work when everyone else has Windows,"Hey!

So I recently switched my personal laptop to Linux and so far I love it and don’t really want to go back. However, I haven’t really done much work on it and haven’t had a chance to see if there will be issues (using LibreOffice, syncing with work networks, etc.) when everyone at work is using Windows.

Has anyone here had any issues with anything 
 and/or advice on things I should expect if I try to use Linux at work? Thank you!","I use linux in a Windows-dominated environment. At first, there were certainly some adjustments needed. Networking has been fine, and thankfully tools such as Dropbox have Linux-native applications. The biggest friction has come with compatability with Microsoft Office. I have found that OnlyOffice has far greater compatility for doc/docx files than LibreOffice. OnlyOffice has also been fantastic for Excel files, in particular Excel spreadsheets that LibreOffice choked on. When it comes to Powerpoint, LibreOffice still is superior in terms of compatability, but there are always small things that dont match up. 

One trick is to make sure you install the microsoft ttf fonts - this really improves compatability and makes your life easier. The packages are distribution dependent - I was able to find all the needed fonts via the Arch Linux Repositories (I use Manjaro).  

If you can use Office365 online, things become much, much easier. There is an unofficial Microsoft OneDrive sync utility (https://github.com/skilion/onedrive) that seems to work quite well, which would help you live in a Microsoft world more easily.

Finally, Adobe support is another area of friction. There is really no Adobe software for linux that is viable any more. The free version of MasterPDFEditor and FoxitReader fill this gap pretty well. Still, there are scenarios where I still receive some PDFs that I cannot open (perhaps ~1% of the time, but still annoying).

With Office365 online, Teams native app for Linux, and OneDrive support, things are much, much better than they were say 5 years ago. The additional emphasis on Electron-based apps has also substantially helped linux users get first-class support, albeit at the cost of some RAM.  

Finally, if you do need to run proprietary software, check out https://github.com/foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM, which automates the install of macos via qemu. Though I do not use this myself, colleagues have found being able to boot macos from time to time to be helpful for those egde cases where you are stuck."
"""PewDiepie Convinced Me to Switch to Linux – Help Me Dual-Boot Without Losing My Uni Files","Hey everyone!

So, my laptop used to run fine on Windows 10, but ever since I ""upgraded"" to Win11, it’s been slow as hell. I tried going back to Win10, but Microsoft removed the rollback option (thanks, I guess?).

Recently, I added a second SSD to my laptop, and after watching PewDiepie’s Linux video, I’m finally ready to make the jump. **But I need help!**

# My Situation:

* **Current OS:** Windows 11 (main SSD, C: drive).
* **Second SSD:** D: drive (empty, can be wiped).
* **Important files:** All my uni work is on C: (Windows drive).
* **Experience:** Used Ubuntu a little, but still a noob.

# What I Want:

**Dual-boot** – Keep Windows 11 but run Linux Mint as my daily driver. (that's what CHATGPT told me to do)  
**Use the second SSD (D:) for Linux** – So I don’t touch my C: drive.  
**Not screw up my laptop** – Final year uni = no time for disasters.

# Questions:

1. **Is dual-booting a good idea?** Will it make my laptop faster, or should I just fully commit to Linux?
2. **Step-by-step guide?** How do I install Linux Mint on the second SSD without breaking Windows?
3. **Will GRUB mess up my bootloader?** (I’ve heard horror stories.)
4. **Any tips for a smooth experience?** 

I’d really appreciate any advice—especially from folks who made the switch recently. Thanks in advance!


**Edit**
Current laptop specs:

Intel i7 11th gen
16 gb ram ( 60% usage with only vscode and chrome running )
C drive SSD ( NVMe) 512gb
D drive SSD (SATA) 512 gb
GPU : Nvidia RTX 3050 ti ( runs like a 1050) 

**EDIT 2**

I WILL BACKUP EVERYTHING before tinkering around.","No.

Just discovered how powerful Krita is,"I've been looking for alternatives for popular Windows programs, and as a YouTuber and musician, I have to design the thumbnails of videos and artworks for my singles. I have always used Photoshop, but I got tired of using cracked versions and keygens and the fact that it simply sucks if you install it with Wine, so I decided to use GIMP, but it has a lot of lacking features and OH MY GOD WHY CAN'T I JUST GRAB THE CORNER TO RESIZE?, Why is the layout so confusing, why are so many useful options hidden behind menus?  


So I searched for other alternatives and found Krita. They should really change the definition of that program. They say it's for digital drawing and artwork, which made me think that it was something like mspaint or Pinta, but YouTube reviews gave me light about it. It's just perfect. I works a lot like Photoshop and even if it did not, it's easy to use and really powerful. I love it. They should say it's a tool for professional photography. The only think I did not like was that I can't use the color picker by pressing Alt, but I can just press P and then B to go back to the brush. Every feature I need is there.


TL;DR: Photoshop does not work on Wine. GIMP is cringe, Krita is based.","yeah, Krita is a very nice piece of software. 

Something I didn't expect: for some voodoo reason is it is often able to open corrupted images that crap out on every single other program. And then you just export it and you're golden..."
What do you REALLY do on Linux that you can't do on Windows/Mac,"So I've been a Windows user my whole life and have very minimal experience with Linux. I've dabbled a bit, but I'm not quite tech savvy enough to really do anything super in depth, like editing operating system files and the like. 

I hear people talking all the time about how Linux gives you so much more freedom to customize your system and what not, but I rarely hear any specific details about what they do, what projects they have done, etc. So my question is what exactly do you do with Linux on a regular basis that you can't do/isn't convenient to do on Windows/OSX? Or at least what are some such projects or tasks you have recently done?","**Fully customized desktop/window management**

Right now I run awesome window manager on my work system.  It has 3 monitors,  Each monitor can independently switch between six ""tags"" (kind of like virtual desktops).  Windows on each monitor/tag are automatically tiled, so they never overlap.  I can control everything from the keyboard.  I have custom rules written to place certain commonly-used programs on specific monitors/tags.  So, for example, I can launch a virtual machine, it will start up in a pre-assigned tag on a certain monitor without covering up what I'm working on.  When it's booted and i'm ready to use it, I can switch over to where it is.

I can go on, but you get the picture.  My environment is highly tailored to reduce friction in my workflow.

**Install it on just about anything for free**

I have a large family and not much income.  People give me old computers sometimes, often 6-10 year old devices.  I know that no matter what I receive, I can install a fresh, supported, fully-functional OS on that device.  I don't have to break any laws, run an outdated OS, or buy some expensive software that may or may not work.

If the hardware is old or low-powered, I can customize the OS to work with it.  The average age of running, daily-use computers in my house is about 5 years, but they all run an OS that is getting security updates and modern software.

**Interact directly with the people who write the software I use**

I record music using a program called qtractor.  Had some questions about it, asked on a linux audio forum -- the author of the program is responding to my questions.  Found some bugs in it, was able to work with him to get them resolved in the next version.  Awesome.

Have had similar experiences with my desktop environment, drivers, distro packaging, editors, etc. etc.  Yes, you have to know how to interact with developers and not be a whiny pest, but it's a cool when you can bring a problem right to the person who can fix it, and work with them to make the software better for everyone.

There's more, but that's what I have off-the-cuff."

Is the switch from Chrome to Firefox worth it?,"I've seen many Linux users (and people who care about privacy and power/cpu usage in general) talk about the downsides to using Chrome and I can see what they mean. I use a laptop so I care about these things. However, I have many things integrated with Google (even using a Pixel 3). I wanted to ask, is the switch from Chrome to Firefox worth it? What are the benefits and downsides (extensions too) and were those benefits worth the switch? How long did it take long to adjust?

edit: thanks for all the helpful advice guys; i really appreciate it :) i've switched to firefox for now since these posts ( thanks to r/firefoxcss for letting me choose a better look! ). i'm enjoying it very much so far besides a few things like the history folder and inconvenience of how bookmarking works. otherwise, it's awesome",I switched to Firefox a long time ago.

"Why dont people always use ""beginner distros"" ?","Hi all, so i made the switch from windows 11 to Linux mint about a week ago and really enjoying it so far.

You can understand the commands after having done a graphical install on Manjaro,  for example , if you didn’t feel confident enough to apply them on a vanilla Arch installation.                               

Why does it have to be bad that you end up understanding them afterwards?

 I may come off like an ass with long explanations, but I do it for a few reasons.  I want to give OP a better understanding of the pieces involved, and how they fit together, and also to provide details for others that may stumble on my reply when researching their own issues.   

Putting my take/solution out there in the public also has the side effect of eliciting unsolicited responses from others that might actually have more optimized solutions, or can point out an unintended side-effect that I may have not experienced.

There are so many reasons to switch to linux...,"## ...and the one that grabbed me is the absolute freedom.

​

**Who should switch to Linux?**

​

When I first heard of Linux, many years ago, it was but a whisper in the wind(ow)s. It barely scraped the surface of my mind as anything other than another niche. It didn't help that I deemed myself an expert in what I felt was the best secured, advanced, and most robust system on the planet earth, Windows XP. Oh but a fool I was, bathing in ignorance.

​

**What is it that causes such bias to a misunderstood masterpiece?**

​

Was it the fear of becoming a beginner in a subject I felt so at home with? Or was it a refusal to move forwards into an endless era of learning rather than bask in blissful expertise. Maybe it was because my mind was so blanketed in caffeine and binge gaming. Little did I know in my ignorance, I would find solace in an unending battle through life.

​

**How does the switch over to Linux take so long?**

​

I pop the SD card in. Too impatient by my sporadic idea to reformat to go get a USB or DVD or even to properly research into what I was doing. *\\*bleep\*\* My laptop boots up and I press F12, anxiously I wait what seems like fourteen generations for the three second long black screen to finish as the laptop loads the boot manager. There was only one option and it was the Windows Boot Manager. *doh* In my rush I forgot to put the SD card in an adapter (it wouldn't boot directly in the SD slot). I boot up again, the anxiety turned somewhat into impatience, and I wait ready. *bash* I hit the F12 key with the force of a thousand boots. This time the boot menu had two options, one of them the SD card.

​

**Why you should never start with Arch Linux.**

​

There is a pretty big problem with Arch Linux. It's absolutely perfect, being an operating system with both great support and nearly unparalleled customizability. For a beginner, the enticement is too much to bare. To fall into the trap of Arch is to spend hours learning from the ground up, only to find in the end you don't have any idea what you just did or how to fix the error you got on step one-hundred and twenty-two. Finally after three attempts, I managed to get all the way to installing GRUB. Despite numerous numbing attempts I couldn't get past an EFI error. In a slump I gave up, having a laptop containing a formatted hard-drive, with random data written over 3 passes...

​

**When you switch to Linux, do yourself a favour and take the time to research.**

​

... I snapped to alertness, in my daze of brewing my third pot of coffee. I have an SD card with Ubuntu on it! I realised in the middle of adding a spoon of coffee grounds to the filter. Almost forgetting entirely of the coffee, I rushed off to my laptop and popped the Ubuntu SD card in. I had a feeling after learning about Arch Linux that I would need a backup distro just in case. The boot process took barely twenty minutes. I hardly knew where to start with my brand new OS, so naturally, my first thought was to open up youtube.

​

**Where do you take yourself from here?**

​

If I had to describe the Linux experience in one word, it would be 'vast'. You can take any technological idea available to the human mind, and undertake it with Linux. The possibilities are only limited by your creativity, and availability of hardware. For myself personally, I will be using it for a business system as well as a research computer. Security has become important to me due to sensitive customer data, and the learning curve to securing a daily use system has been both daunting and rewarding. I sit here now, watching 'The Office' on Netflix, typing out some creativity as I dwell on some Wireshark idea's.

​

I hope everybody who has swapped over to Linux has a tale to tell, no matter how long or small. It takes effort to switch and learn a new system, what is it that really brought you to undertake the battle?

​

Cheers

No, they haven't.  Their Windows requirements page has a link for ""supported CPUs"", and that link goes to their list of CPUs supported *for OEMS*.  Given the fact that the same page says that Windows 10 CPU support goes back only to 5-year-old CPUs, I think we can safely conclude that this is a mix-up in Microsoft's site, and that end users don't actually need one of those CPUs to run Windows 11."
PSA: I reduced my boot time from ~30 seconds to ~3 seconds by editing a single file (Linux Mint 19.1),"I noticed in my system log that the step `random: crng init done` took around 30 seconds to complete on boot, and after Googling I found a suggestion that I edit `/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume`: originally it read `RESUME=UUID=`(Some random UUID that didn't even correspond to one of my partitions). After changing it to ~~RESUME=none~~ my root partition UUID and re-initializing with `sudo update-initramfs -u -k all`, my boot time dropped from over 30 seconds to just over 3 seconds!

FYI to noobs on Arch (and soon Manjaro) using anything with Python from the AUR,"When using PKGBUILDs from the AUR you are responsible for updates and rebuilds. With python 3.9 hitting official repos you'll need to rebuild any package with a python 3.8 dependency that you made from the AUR. If you are on Manjaro you'll need to sit tight for a little while and keep and eye out for a huge python update and then do the same thing. 

You can identify these packages by looking for any that have files in the `/usr/lib/python3.8/` directory using `pacman -Qoq /usr/lib/python3.8/`. You'll then need to rebuild them either with an AUR helper like `yay` or with standard ABS `makepkg`.","Read over the intended principles: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux

Hello All!

For a while now I have been interested in installing Linux on my personal laptop!

I want to switch to Linux because I’m my personal opinion I don’t really like Windows 10.
(Bugs design etc)

I have a few questions!

1. Can my laptop run Linux, in specific Ubuntu.

My laptop is pretty old, I don’t really know the specs but I’ll link the laptop below.

https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-Ideapad-310-15ABR-80ST.186978.0.html

2. Is there any risks in switching from Windows 10 to Ubuntu.

I really don’t want to mess up my laptop when switching so can anyone let me know what the risks are.

3. Should I Fully Install It Or Sideload it.

4. What Version of Linux is recommended for first time use.

5. How do I install it?


Thanks for reading, And I hope I can get it up and running and join this amazing community!","Your laptop will almost definitely run Ubuntu - one of my PCs is over 10 years old and still doing OK.

You might also consider a distro like Linux Mint which is very slick and designed to make it easier for people coming from Windows. It's Ubuntu + some other stuff, so you can still run programs designed for Ubuntu. Or you can just run Ubuntu if that's your thing.

I'm not sure about ""risks."" If you plan to dual-boot with Windows (so you get a prompt when you switch on your PC and can boot either Windows or Linux) the risk is you accidentally wipe your Windows during the Linux install process. But just be careful which buttons you click when asked what you want to do. If you plan to wipe your Windows completely, just ensure you have your data backed up to USB or somewhere else.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""side-load"". The options are:

- Install Linux and wipe your Windows off the laptop.
- Install Linux alongside Windows, at which point you can boot either to Windows or Linux.
- Use a virtual machine under Linux and run Windows in that.

For the virtual machine (VM) option, you could look at VirtualBox which is a free download. You can run Linux in that and get a feel of whether it's right for you or not. You can practice installing Linux in the VM with the certain knowledge the only thing you will break if you get it wrong, is the VM, not the PC you are running it on. Switch to full-screen mode in the VM and it will be pretty much the same as running Linux native.

As for how to install, download the ISO (DVD image) of the distro you want. If you plan to install it on your laptop use a tool like Rufus, BalenaEtcher or YUMI (google) to copy it to a USB key, boot off that USB key and then follow the prompts.

If you want to run a VM, go to the VM configuration and select the Linux ISO as the optical device (so it's available as a DVD in the VM). You will either get a step-by-step installer, or be booted to a Linux desktop in ""live mode"" which gives you the chance to try it out for a bit. If you want to install, there will be an ""Install Linux"" link on the desktop.

**Note** that all this is just an outline. Google is your friend, learn to read the docs from the distro (usually ""Getting Started"" or ""Installation""). I highly recommend trying things out in a VM first then see if you want to make the jump to full-time use. The learning you get from using VMs will be very valuable whatever you choose - they are used *everywhere* nowadays. And so is Linux, by-and-large, so you can't go wrong by learning some more about both technologies."
0 experience with Linux but I saw someone post about installing Lubuntu (sp?) on their Grandma's older laptop and getting much better performance and I'm thinking of trying that,"My wife has an 11 year old Macbook pro and it runs super slow. My buddy got an old laptop from his deceased mom last year but even after completely wiping it it was still slow as well. 

My wife mostly just needs something for internet browsing, using square space to edit an online shop, Google sheets and other low usage stuff like that (we have a desktop for CAD and stuff like that but she wants something for the couch.) 

I'm at work so I do not have any info on the laptop that would be upgraded but I could get that when I get home, but I'm the meantime:

1) Is this something I should pursue or was what I saw a kind of specific case (I can link to the OP if need be?)

2) Am I having to buy Linux or anything or how does one even go about doing this? I'm not technically illiterate but I have no coding experience or really deep software knowledge.

3) is there any way to get any of the functionality of a Mac onto Linux? My wife likes the way the touchpad for Mac works (I think touching with two fingers allows you to page scroll and stuff like.) 

I appreciate any input and if you need any information I'll try my best to provide it. Thank you","1. If you want something ""mac-like"" then go look at [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/), it's a Linux distribution which is inspired by the ethos of OSX.

You can pay for it if you wish, as much or as little as you want, just remember paying keeps development going.

As for the laptop, have a look at whether you could upgrade the memory and install an SSD drive to get the most out of it. (Letting us know the make/model would help)

For what you've described, most Linux distros will do.

&#x200B;

2. That behaviour is pretty much in every Linux distro including elementary OS, some will let you do 3 finger gestures or 2 finger side swiping too.

Most Linux distributions will let you try the OS from the USB drive without even installing them, you'll need to make either a DVD install or use something like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) on Windows to make a bootable drive from an ISO."
Long time Windows user finally on board with Linux!,"So I have been working on a help desk for a little over 3 years now (doing some system engineering task recently as well) and I have also been on a huge kick in getting my certifications ( this year so far I got A+ Network + and hopefully security + by next week) and while continuing my studies, I have just grown fascinated with Linux. 

As someone who’s entire exposure to Linux has been through just simply installing Ubuntu for clients, I am very proud to say that I have finally taken the lunge and downloaded Ubuntu 20.04 on my own personal system! 

I never posted on a Linux sub Reddit before but I have been a long time lurker and it’s because of the community, which finally convinced me to switch sides. I am basically the biggest Noob out there in regards to this ecosystem but I’m down for a challenge! 

Anyways, i know this is a very small thing to do but I just had to share it with someone.

Why is Arch Linux so loved by everyone?,"I use Ubuntu for school (I'm studying network administration), and Fedora KDE for home, and I always come across arch as the best Linux distribution. 

Maybe because Arch allows you to customize how you want to use it?","i always considered ""i use arch btw"" as a cry for help"
What linux distro should I pick?,"So I want to switch from Windows to Linux but I have no idea which distro to choose.
Preferably one for programming, watching videos and surfing the web.
Any suggestions?","I personally think that the whole deal about finding just the right distro for one's specific needs is somewhat exaggerated. Once you get used to Linux you can get pretty much any distro to do what you want. By then you'll know what you want (and what you want to get rid of) and how to do it.

What really matters here is that it is your first time setting up a Linux system. For the first time, I recommend trying any distro that is easy to install and has a plenty of documentation and an active community to answer all the possible problems you might encounter while getting used to Linux. You don't need to feel like that is the one and only distro you will ever use because the differences between distros can often be quite marginal - and it will be easy to hop to another distro once you've learned the ropes of one.

In short: Ubuntu and Linux Mint both fit the bill very well. I personally used them only very briefly and quickly jumped to using Arch and Debian, but they are a pretty easy way to get in. Other distros tend to be more challenging when installing the OS or when using daily. Or they lack documentation or you won't find answers to possible problems."
Has there been an increase in interest in Linux?,"I've only been here on Reddit for about two years or so, but it seems lately not a day goes by without someone inquiring in this sub about the migration from Windows to Linux. Longtimers, has interest increased? I myself was a refugee from Win7 when I ran out of disk space for updates, the system went into an endless loop, and I got fed up. And Linux works as advertised! Perhaps the only product in the world to live completely up to expectations, and then some.","Speaking for myself - my personal experience on Windows just kept getting worse and worse.

For more advanced use cases you may still need `apt-get`, but in general you should stick to `apt` for managing packages."
"If I type ""python"" in Terminal, it runs Python 2. If I type ""python3"", it runs Python 3.

Many things specifically require Python 2 or 3 and are not compatible with the other. I would recommend you not create a situation where you're fooling yourself and acclimate yourself to using the correct command as-is. There's a big world of Python out there, and if your `python` is everyone else's `python3` you're gonna have a bad time.

Pro tip: add a shebang to the top of your python scripts and make them executable, then you can run them directly: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6908143/should-i-put-shebang-in-python-scripts-and-what-form-should-it-take](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6908143/should-i-put-shebang-in-python-scripts-and-what-form-should-it-take)

Why shouldn’t switch to Linux (From a Linux user),"In my opinion, Linux is better than Windows, and I think many of you reading this agree, but it’s not perfect.
The Linux community likes to talk about all of the upsides of Linux, but I think it’s also important to talk about all the reasons Linux might not be for you.
We don’t want to convince someone Linux is better, just for something to get in the way of that, and leave a bad taste in their mouth.
Here are some reasons you might NOT want to switch to Linux

- You NEED a program for work. (If you’re flexible, there are plenty of free alternatives to programs, but some workplaces might require for example MS office)

- You don’t have a lot of free time. (Initially setting up Linux takes time, as well as more time to get use to, and to troubleshoot. But not everyone has time to do that.)

- You don’t want to switch to Linux (If someone wants to continue using Windows, we should let them. The Linux community supports freedom, right?

- If you expect support from the computer manufacturer. (I’m not saying that no companies provide support for Linux on your computer, but many companies don’t, and it’s important to keep that in mind)

All of that said, here are some reasons you SHOULD switch to Linux.

- You have many problems with Windows (Windows can be very buggy sometimes, and it might enough for you to want to try something else.)

- You want a challenge. (If you have the time, daily driving Linux can be very fun, it gives a bit of a challenge. That’s not to say Linux itself is challenging, but any switching of an entire operating system WILL be challenging)

- You have slow hardware (Windows is very bloated, slowing it down A LOT. This isn’t as noticeable on modern hardware, but if you have an old laptop that is too slow for windows, and you want to keep on using it, Linux is known for breathing life into otherwise unusable computers.)","I've used Windows and Linux in parallel, on separate computers, for close to two decades.

The core principle that was hammered into my head in the 1960's (use case determines requirements, requirements determine selection) is the critical factor for selecting an operating system, as is the case with all technology decisions.

If Linux isn't a good fit for your use case, then don't use Linux.  Trying to fit a use case into an operating system is the rough equivalent of pounding a square peg into a round hole.

Just follow your use case."

Switching parents' computer to Linux : a feedback,"Hi, 

A couple of weeks ago I asked some questions about switching my parents' PC from W10 to Linux Mint.  I saw them this weekend and decided to do a test with an old Windows Vista PC they no longer use because it was painfully slow. Didn't bother with the data that was on it so I didn't go for a dual boot.I chose Linux Mint XFCE as the PC is getting quite old (2009-10 I think). I also considered Linux Lite but Mint seems to be have more support and documentation. 

Preparation : a 8GB USB key, balena etcher installed on another computer, download the iso file you need. Then create your bootable device.

The rest was crazy simple : turn the computer on, start on the USB device instead of Windows then use the installation wizard that's really well though. In 2h max I revived an old computer that was supposed to go to trash. All the pilots you need are detected and installed on first start. Basic softwares are also pre-installed (Firefox, Thunderbird, libreoffice).

Mint XFCE is quite barebone but still very usable for noob parents since the UI is quite close to Windows (start menu at bottom left, you can drag&drop icons and files). As I read on some forums Mint XFCE is not crazy lightweight but it's still light enough to work on 10y-o PC, much better than Vista (not really hard you might say). To me Mint XFCE is a nice balance between accessibility (pre-installed softwares, simple installation) and lightweight. 

I setup Firefox and mail just like their W10 PC. I left them the computer for them to test, they can't do anything wrong since there is actually nothing on the computer. If this experience works, I will switch their W10 PC too, maybe try Mint Mate or Cinnamon.",It's always wonderful to hear about old computers getting a new life. Thanks for sharing.
I feel like I spend the majority of my time trying to learn how to use Linux/Github than actually using it. Is that common?,"I'm relatively new to Linux. I've had it for about 2 weeks now. Before switching, I began learning command line with Cygwin and Bash and have been enjoying that. In the beginning things were a mess since I didn't really understand the file structure on Linux or how to download packages (that's something I'm trying to learn) so I just downloaded things using commandline. Saw it show up in a folder and thought that was sufficient.  I've tried transitioning CLI into linux. For the most part, things are fine. I installed Solus OS as my first Distro even though I realize it has limitations. For me, it really is the small things that give me trouble. I am learning that distros have package managers and getting used to those. However, when a package isn't available I'm left with Github, and I really don't understand how to install things using that. I know I can use wget, curl, etc. I know how to unpack tarball and unzip zip. I know now that it installs into whatever directory I'm in unless I specify. Outside of that, I'm lost due to the following:

1. I go to the latest release of a github page and there are 4 files for example. Tarball, zip, master, source etc. I don't know which to get. Just one? All of them?
2. I don't know where to install them in the file directory
3. I don't know how to install them. When to use make install, often times it's not available
4. I don't know which files I can delete and clean up afterwards
5. I don't know when to use wget and when to use curl

Yesterday I tried following this to set up vim for Python IDE:  [https://realpython.com/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/](https://realpython.com/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/) 

Everything was fine except for the YouCompleteMe plugin. I couldn't figure out how to make it work because of the c compiler problem and then the Solus package manager kept telling me in the terminal that cmake3 wasn't available and neither was g++. I decided to leave it and figure it out later. This is what I mean, though. I have to stop and research what cmake and g++ is and that derails trying to get this one thing I need since those are dependencies. I know I'm impatient and want to jump in and have fun and that's my fault. It's just that it gets exhausting.

Things like /.bashrc /.profile /.vimrc are confusing but I'm getting more comfortable. I've tried adding certain themes only to have CLI tell me there are errors and they don't exist. Neomutt has been the worst with this.

Another even more simple thing. Yesterday I wanted to set up Plex and move some movies on my external hard drive to the server so my family can watch them across the country. Well, root owns almost all directories and files on the hard drive. So, I tried googling and typing stuff in but none of it worked. So I decided to come back to it. However, using google and typing things in with a vague understanding causes issues. Using cygwin on windows in the last two months I have already accidentally deleted all files matching a pattern by using a wildcard. This morning I accidentally set my C: drive permissions to octal code 130 (basically only NT-Admin/System can access it now. I can't even open or read it). So, I had to email IT about that to unlock it and am still waiting for a response. I've definitely been learning to be careful with CLI and have started adding certain safeguards like rm -i into config files. I imagine you mess up a lot to learn.

Am I doing something wrong or is this just the common learning curve? Where can I find information like this that guides you through things like drive permissions, installations, etc? Some things I come across on google are hard to follow as a beginner and some have lead to issues with command line as I've mentioned.",It is in the beginning.
For people who can't access WiFi straight after a new install: You can use your smartphone's USB Tethering.,"For whatever reasons, some systems(especially laptops) may not have proper drivers for the WiFi, or maybe there are additional steps to enable wireless networking.

Most linux distor's if not all of them support USB tethering of your phone's internet. If you have network-manager or any such application installed it should show up as a wired connection.

It can also be enabled via the commandline:

You will need superuser rights(use sudo):

`sudo ip link set <your device name>`

If you press tab it'll show you the device name for the USB tethering. For example these are my devices when I press tab.

     sudo ip link set 
     eno1         enp0s20f0u1  lo           wlo1

The enp0s20f0u1 is what I'm looking for.

I found this particularly useful when I was using a live usb and it didn't have the wifi driver. Aside from being able to use the Data connection from my phone, if my phone is connected to a wifi, I can use that wifi connection on the laptop via usb tethering. So that helped me download and install the required drivers.

I don't know much about the details, but if you have a relatively new laptop, and a smartphone it should work.

Hope it helps.

Cheers.",You can enable this on arch linux from the live cd by simply typing dhcpcd at the command prompt after tethering your phone.
"For the love of god, could someone please explain to me how to install programs from .tar files like I'm 5 years old?","First of all, I wanna say that I recently switched over from Windows to Ubuntu and I like how powerful, fast, and flexible it is. That being said, How the FUCK do I do anything?

Please someone help me.","You should really use the package manager to install programs when possible.  If the program isn't in the repos, and there isn't a repo available to add then see if they offer a .deb file before going to a source tarball.  Most of the time it's just `./configure && make && make install` but there should be a README or an INSTALL file with instructions.  There will likely also be dependencies that you'll have to install first if you want to build packages from source."
How To Set Up Ubuntu 20.04 For Gaming Tutorial,"Hi everyone.

With the latest release of Ubuntu and the ever growing popularity of Linux gaming in general, I thought it would be a good idea to produce a quick video that covers the steps you need do in order to set up the latest version of Ubuntu for gaming.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DToZ9wU2qRk&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DToZ9wU2qRk&feature=youtu.be)

This video covers setting up Ubuntu 20.04 for gaming on Linux including installing GPU drivers, Wine Staging, Lutris, Steam with Proton enabled, and setting up Feral Gamemode to work with games loaded from both Lutris and Steam.

But for people who prefer a written guide, see below:

**Step 1: Install the latest GPU driver that supports DXVK for your system.**

For nVidia GPU:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa

sudo apt install nvidia-driver-440 libnvidia-gl-440 libnvidia-gl-440:i386

sudo apt install libvulkan1 libvulkan1:i386

Restart your system once done.

For AMD / Intel GPU:

sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386

sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dri:i386

sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers mesa-vulkan-drivers:i386

Restart once done.

**Step 2: Install The Latest Version of Wine Staging Branch**

sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 wget -nc [https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/win](https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/win)...

sudo apt-key add winehq.key

sudo apt-add-repository 'deb [https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubu](https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubu)... eoan main'

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install --install-recommends wine-staging

sudo apt-get install libgnutls30:i386 libldap-2.4-2:i386 libgpg-error0:i386 libxml2:i386 libasound2-plugins:i386 libsdl2-2.0-0:i386 libfreetype6:i386 libdbus-1-3:i386 libsqlite3-0:i386

**Step 3: Install The Latest Version of Lutris**

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:lutris-team/lutris

sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install lutris

**Step 4: Install Steam and Enable Proton For All Games**

sudo apt install steam

Once installed, open Steam and sign into your account.

Navigate to Steam / Settings / Steam Play / Advanced and tick Enable Steam Play for all other titles.

Once done, restart Steam to apply.

**Step 5: Enable Feral Gamemode for Steam and Lutris.**

By default in Ubuntu 20.04, Gamemode is preinstalled, but it still needs to be enabled manually for games.

For Steam, right click on the Properties of a game, click on SET LAUNCH OPTIONS.. and then type the following: gamemoderun %command% Click OK, and then Close to apply.

For Lutris, navigate to Preferences / System options / Command prefix and type in the following: gamemoderun

How to Dual-boot?,"Hi, I am in love with Linux. But I don't want to leave Windows because of many reasons. I am considering Dual-booting with Linux. I just want to start out so I am considering Ubuntu 20.04. I have been searching on Dual-booting for almost a day now, but I couldn't get a single one which was ""clear-cut"". Could anyone give me some link on how to dualboot which has a clear guide? Also, I have 512GB SSD on which I have Windows and 1TB HDD on which there are some useless files. 

Love this community!

btw I am Meganoob, plz be kind","Honestly, 500gb SSD's are dirt cheap now. If it really does interest you, get another drive and try it out. If it doesn't end up being your mainly driver, that's okay. If you want to just go back to windows, you can have an extra drive for your games.  


Either way, I'd definitely consider just getting a separate drive if you [can.](https://can.It) it's the safest/easiest, so if something goes wrong you won't risk your windows install."
What is the difference between using apt and apt-get?,"If they `apt` and `apt-get` virtually the same thing, why have them both?","Apt is more user oriented and looks nicer, apt-get is more easily parsed for scripts and other programs that might care about it's text output."

Enjoy a game every now and then, mostly then rather than now (read : rarely ever have time).

Brief list of demands/hopes/wishes :

 - I would like to be able to use all of my machine's hardware to the maximum ; Need good up to date drivers. Especially for the network card, as I currently do not have access to anything but wifi atm.

- I would like for the following programs (or good alternatives) to be available :
          *Android Studio
          * Pretty much everything by IntelliJ
          * text editing software which provides extensions readable on all OS's.
          * hopeful wish - I would like to be able to play Magic the Gathering Online and Magic the Gathering Arena. 
          * I would like to not have to hop OS every 2 months, so one with long term support/dev, not in danger of being deprecated would be a massive pre.

I am willing to put in a lot of effort in getting to understand the OS if necessary.

Please guide me into an OS suitable for my needs, oh mighty overlords.

Nvidia is really bad,"99% of people who have problems with linux, are gamers with Nvidia cards. 

The Nouveau drivers work great, but the performance of your graphics card will be massively reduced, so you need the proprietary drivers. This works reasonably well in xorg, especially if your distro supports one-click install, trying to manually install the drivers often makes people crash their system because they try to install it on the desktop while nouveau is still active, completely breaking their system. 

On Wayland it is a buggy mess, and usually results in everything breaking if you don' t know what you are doing.

I recommend new linux users to go for AMD because everything just works out of the box, and gaming has come a long way with steam and proton. AMD has proper open-source drivers that often work better than the windows drivers. 

If you do use Nvidia, I don' t recommend using a free distro like Debian, but one that supports a one-click proprietary driver installation like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and even Arch through the archinstall script.","It works reasonably ok in Ubuntu with the proprietary drivers, but it's still problematic - for example the drivers were crashing my kernel after every kernel update and I had to manually delete modules and reinstall the kernel every time to fix the issue. Not a good user experience.

Before that, I was always using Intel's integrated graphics and they never gave me any trouble - but then again they are awful for gaming."

Can someone explain me ubuntu hate?,"I've seen many people just hating on ubuntu. 
And they mostly prefer mint over ubuntu for beginner distro...

Also should I hate it too??","Ubuntu is developed by a corporation, Canonical.

They have done a lot of amazing work making Linux easier to use and more accessible.

Now,  that said, they have also made some… questionable decisions in the space that has really soured their reputation. 

Snaps is the latest one. They are sandboxed applications that as long as you have their backend installed will run in any Linux distro. This is undoubtedly good, but while they made snap development open source, the snap ""store"" where you downloaded them from is proprietary from canonical, potentially giving them a stranglehold over them that goes against FOSS philosophy.

Since then, Flatpaks have emerged (some people are not aware that Snaps precede them), which for general usage purpose the same thing, but they are fully FOSS unlike snaps and have been more widely adopted across the Linux space.

Despite this, Canonical continues to push Snaps, and they use their big market share (by Linux standards) to do so, which continues to rub people the wrong way.

They have also had other controversies through the years, so they have very much lost most of the good faith and rep they had built in the Linux community.

Ubuntu is still a solid distro, and you can use it with no issues, but it's good to know the background about it."
"PSA: If you get stuck, go to sleep","Sharing my experience here. If you are having a hard time after many formats, installs and tweaking and you feel your energy is getting drained, go to sleep.

No seriously, don't be stubborn. It is ok to be stubborn in computing, but it always works better if it is the ""I slept 8 hours and had pancakes"" kind of stubborn.

The whole fam damily Linuxing: An encouragement post to switch to Linux,"&#x200B;

[Linuxing](https://preview.redd.it/qwgz1gb9b2m71.jpg?width=4608&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4bb6f25ada8fe27b4cb300fdd0e8d3ea8d80ed22)

These four computers (3 laptops + 1 desktop) are in our family house. As you can see in the photos, each computer has its own relative hardware resources. So I set up a separate linux distribution to each computer, taking into account the use-case of each family member, and targeting the most up-to-date software and optimal performance possible. So for the last few years, my mother, sister and I have been using only and only Linux-based operating systems on all our personal computers for surfing the internet, maintaining our education, and more complex data jobs. Anyone can use linux, never hesitate to switch to Linux and convince your people to switch to Linux.

From left to right, the OSs:

1. [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/)
2. [Pop!\_OS](https://pop.system76.com/)
3. [ZorinOS](https://zorin.com/os/)
4. [Ubuntu Mate](https://ubuntu-mate.org/)","Well, people with hard software dependencies to which are no alternatives available cannot switch, but in general yes a lot of people can switch. *Especially* people who have little to no previous computer knowledge. That's perfect actually. It's much harder when you've already grown heavily used to e.g. Windows and its typical software ecosystem, to make the switch."
Why are Package Managers considered superior to Installers?,"Not a jab. Just genuinely curious.

Do the supposed benefits of package managers also apply to Windows (e.g. Chocolatey)?","> Why are Package Managers considered superior to Installers?

The important, not to say critical, difference:

* An installer (generally) makes no effort to coordinate its installs with what is already installed, so if it replaces a library or driver, this may prevent another program from running.

* A package manager *does* coordinate installs, to prevent package conflicts, as a result of which some installs will fail, in order to to prevent a package conflict that would disable the present install or an earlier one.

The library conflict problem -- called [""dependency hell""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell) BTW -- can be resolved by installing sandboxed applications, meaning applications bundled with all their required libraries, so their requirements are guaranteed to be met. This gets around the package manager coordination responsibility by not requiring anything from the system.

Examples of sandboxing schemes are AppImages and Flatpaks, each of which bundle all requirements in an isolated environment, thus avoiding the package conflict issue in exchange for larger install sizes and slower launches."
I wish there was a real equivalent to MS Word,"Tried to make the switch to Linux (Mint), and I really prefer the Linux system over any iOS/Windows without a doubt, resources-wise - the performance is fantastic, and I love the configurability in general. Except for one thing that I just cant do without it: a text editor software that is on-par with Microsoft's Word (365). 

I don't mean to disregard anyone's opinions and/or efforts, just that I honestly wish there was a quality solution for office needs, which integrates well with RTL languages and offers the malleability Word offers.   
I've tried adjusting LibreOffice & failed grotesquely, same with WPS office, both we're far from ""it"" for my specific professional needs. Also OpenOffice didn't deliver.   
So I've tried Obsidian - and got lost in that dark hole quicker than an oiled snake down in a rabbit's burrow haha  
Is there no way to use MS 365 in a Linux environment (excluding web ver.)? Is it a lost cause? 

I'm close to offering the ""Rumpelstilzchen Deal"" to name a firstborn (not mine though) after the one who will conjure the golden advice & solve this matter ;-)  
   
Well, Thanks in advance y'all :)","I've used Windows and Linux in parallel on side-by-side computers for over 15 years in part because of this issue.  Although LibreOffice works well for my personal use, and I use LibreOffice on both Windows and Linux for personal use, for my professional use, which entails collaboration on complex documents across multiple drafts, LibreOffice just isn't good enough.  

The ability to open/save in Microsoft formats is not enough for that use case.   I need 100% compatibility, top-to-bottom.  I looked into Microsoft 365 Web, but the web version does not support numerous tools/features in the documents I work with in a collaborative environment.

You might consider running Windows/Microsoft 365 in a VM, if your computer will handle the load."
It's only been a couple months and I forgot how much Windows sucks,"Just as a bit of history, I used every version of Windows since 3.1.  I was a WindowsMe apologist. I often downplayed how badly Vista performed. I thought Windows 10 was actually a step in the right direction. Then, with the help of a friend, realized how slow my system was due to bloat and telemetry. I knew Windows 10 was a privacy nightmare but ya know ""I'm boring, what do I have to hide?""

&#x200B;

Then a system update removed my audio drivers and I got BSOD every 15 or so minutes. No problem, I hadn't reinstalled for a year or two. Everything on the up and up again after downloading drivers and going to each website to download programs.

&#x200B;

Fast forward a month or two and I, like an idiot, updated again.  This time my user account was corrupted and there was a boot loop issue. Wonderful. Another fresh install later and I decided to throw Linux on a new SSD to make sure it wasn't my aged hardware that was causing all the issues.

&#x200B;

Roughly two months later and I have only booted up my Windows HD twice. This morning I did it to help troubleshoot a problem my friend was having. Well, I had to update. Failed downloads, reboot, check for updates, download one thing, reboot, wait 5 thousand forevers for Windows to do something behind the scenes that it doesn't want you to see, check for updates again... it seriously took waaaaay too long.

&#x200B;

After getting centralized app updates (windows users can mitigate this somewhat with chocolatey) and well laid out system updates in Manjaro, where I could actually see what it was doing so I didn't think it was frozen or changing something it shouldn't, I had forgotten what a pain Windows actually is. I can actually make a case now that Linux is easier on a daily basis than Windows. I think Windows breaks more than Arch is rumored to.

&#x200B;

I seriously can't be alone in this. How many other noobs here have gone back into Windows for the first time in a while and had a similar experience?

&#x200B;

\- From Windows Support site -

Windows 10 is a service, which means it gets better through periodic software updates.

It only took me 3.5 hours but windows is updated finally. Troubleshooting took me another 30 minutes. My billable hours would be for S\*\*\*","> I think Windows breaks more than Arch is rumored to.

(I made this) Linux terminal program which graphically displays your partitions/disks,"Several months ago I switched to Linux and fell in love with open source projects and wanted to create my small piece of useful tool people can use.

So I created [**vizex**](https://github.com/bexxmodd/vizex) which is a terminal program for the UNIX/Linux systems. vizex helps the user to visualize the disk space usage for every partition and media disks on the user's machine. **vizex** is highly customizable and can fit any user's taste and preferences. You can display vertical bars or horizontal bars and modify colors and styles of the text/graphs/header and exclude disks.

For the next release, I will add a pie chart as a graph option and thinking to include some other details about partitions and/or maybe give some data about the disk usage (any suggestions are welcome)

I packaged it with PyPI so if you want to try it out all you need to do is install with `pip install vizex`  
 and then run the `vizex` command in your terminal.

Any feedback suggestions opinions or contributions are encouraged!","I may be blind, but do you have any screenshots of it in action? I'm much more inclined to download something like this, especially something which has a focus on the visual aspect, if I can see what it looks like first.

Should I make a switch to linux??? I'm really confused,"I'm 16 and I have a good bit of time on my hands, I've recently been doing some research and I don't like the telemetry data that Microsoft is collecting (it honestly makes me super uncomfortable that they collect so much data.)

I'm working with an old asus note book (model x541n) that my mom broke and gave to me and Windows 10 OS is so bloated that it's sucking the life out of it, so I'm willing to make the switch because I know that most linux OS are way less bloated and slow.

But there's one problem for me, I've been looking at videos and the more I do the more confused I get (some people say switch some people say don't) I have the time on my hands and I'm willing to learn linux and the terminal but I just don't know how to go about it or if I'm even doing the right thing.

I almost installed Etcher from etcher.net,"This is kind of a question type post as much as it is a warning type post.

So do you guys have any ideas as to where it could be gone? What it did while it was ""Growing plants"" and etc... ?

Also, my bad, I didn't read so important command twice. So the command which got entered was
```
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda

Will learning Linux benefit me if I plan to pursue a career in Data Science?,"Hi,
I’m currently learning to program, and my goal is to become a data scientist. I’ve been using python mostly. 

I’ve alway wanted to gain knowledge about the CLI and recently picked up ‘The Linux Command Line’ book. I’ve read almost 1/3 of it and really enjoy it but it doesn’t seem like better familiarity with the CLI(or Linux specifically) will benefit me in my professional pursuits. 
So my question is: how can Linux benefit a data scientist?

———-
EDIT: Thank you everyone, all your replies have really motivated me to keep at learning Linux. I couldn’t respond to all the comments but all were helpful. I think I should add a strong community as another reason to learn Linux.","Yes.

I used to work as a Linux sysadmin at a university mathematics department.  We provided computing environments for masters students, phd candidates, etc.

We got requests all the time from data scientists who kept hitting Linux related walls because they didn't know how to do basic stuff like setup a Python virtualenv, compile some random ass dependency they needed, etc.  When I sat down with these guys to try to help them improve their workflow, it would absolutely blow their minds when I told them they could configure/make/make install right in their home directory without root instead of waiting a day for someone from our team to respond.  

Meanwhile we had data scientists who were Linux experts and those guys worked so fast because nothing Linux related stopped them.  Not only in terms of like package dependencies and that sort of self-management, they had decked out bashrc's with all sorts of aliases and shortcuts that worked magic, while the non-Linux guys were still typing each command one by one (some not even aware of bash completion).

So while Linux is obviously not a requirement for data science, it can be a great swiss army knife for improving your work techniques, workflows, and enabling you to solve your own problems."
Take it from a noob: try Arch,"Ok, by some standards, I'm not a noob. I've been using Linux off and on since high school but never as my main driver and never for longer than a month or so. I was a Windows guy through and through (and still am, technically since I dual boot due to software needs). But for the longest time, I never understood why people would use Arch. It seems like so much work! You have set everything up yourself!? Just use a distro that gives you everything right out of the box!

Then I tried it. I thought ""what the hell"" and installed it. Or... *tried* to install it. First time through I rebooted to find that I couldn't connect to the internet despite using an ethernet cable. So I tried again and accidentally screwed something up so that I just booted to the ""grub>"" prompt. And I tried again and again until I finally got it.

But I realized something as I was doing this. Each failed installation attempt was *teaching* me something. I learned more about how Linux works (and how to fix problems) in one frustrating afternoon trying to install Arch than I had in years from trying Ubuntu, Red Hat, Suse, CentOS, and damn near every other distribution out there!

How does SSH work?,"Before you are going to down-vote me and put me on the woodpile, I DID research but without luck. I know that SSH is extremely simple and that I'd be pretty stupid not to understand it.

I'm trying to control a PC running a live installation image on my network to my host PC, I don't want any funky passwords or keys, I just want to connect, so how do I do this?

Edit: I should have deleted this before it blew up, thanks for taking the effort to comment after I marked it as solved :)","So high level, there is `ssh` service (client) and `sshd` daemon (server/ background). You need to start `sshd` on the computer you are trying to connect to. You then need to run `ssh` on the computer you are trying to connect from. Likely you'll need to know the IP of the target computer and username / password on the target computer.

For example, when I connect to one of my servers, I  enter `ssh ke151@192.168.2.15`. Since I have `sshd` running, I can log in as my user with my password.

Without further steps, I'm not aware of a way to log in without interaction at least once. SSH is not set up to work in a completely unauthenticated manner."
The real use case for Linux for an ordinary person?,"I've read many articles on how Linux is ""also"" able to do such and such, like, Libre Office can almost be like Microsoft Office, and darkroom is almost Lightroom. But I am wondering, for the majority of folks, i.e. not required to use Linux for Enterprise purposes, what is the real use case for Linux, as in, what does Llnux do better than any other OS, what is the main reasons that Linux is installed on your PC/laptop rather than Windows or IOS or Android, and what can Linux do that in fact, another OS cannot?

I do know that in the Web server/hosting arena, Linux is the go-to OS, so there is that, but I wonder, what other reasons are there? Or to put it another way, if you wanted to tell a newbie why Linux is the best OS for them, what convincing reasons would you say, that would show them that Linux is going to do it better than Microsoft/Apple/Google?","It's so much lighter than windows.

Im not doing anything really ""hardcore"" on my pc, just some crap in powerpoint or word for school, and sometimes i launch some indie games out of boredom, i also kinda wanna get into coding (python atm) but the flair describes my level of coding, lol. Oh and btw i have a laptop with ryzen 5 and dedicated graphics, would mint suit it? Highly thankful for any help :D","Boot a live copy of it using a USB stick, that way you can test it without installing it to your laptop."
I can't believe I'm enjoying mint,"Microsoft just pushed me over the edge - I officially gave up and switched my dad’s old laptop to Linux Mint, and holy hell, it’s the best it’s ever run.\*\*My dad’s laptop is a **2016 MSI GP62 6QE Leopard**. It’s old, but not trash, the specs are:

* Intel i5 6300HQ (6th gen, quad-core)
* GTX 950M
* 32GB DDR4 (yeah I maxed it out lol, even mixed 2400 and 3200 sticks)
* 512GB NVMe SSD (Kingston NV2 Gen4, even though the mobo only supports Gen3 - it still works, just not full speed)

So I figured, let’s push it and install Windows 11 on it. Used Rufus to bypass all the TPM/Secure Boot/CPU checks. It worked... **for a few weeks**.Then Microsoft did what it does best: force updates that ruin everything.Laptop started **randomly crashing**. Boot loops, blue screens, total instability. Event Viewer kept screaming about **Intel TPM Provisioning Service** errors. I disabled TPM in BIOS. Still crashed. I nuked and reinstalled:

* Windows 10 Pro 22H2 - crashed
* Windows 11 LTSC - crashed
* Ghost Spectre debloated ISOs with all updates and telemetry gutted - still crashed.

Turns out, **Microsoft basically killed TPM 1.2 support silently**, even on builds where it's technically still ""supported."" And when you dig into it, newer versions of Windows 10 and 11 still try to initialize TPM/IME/virtualization stuff at a kernel level, even if you turn that crap off in BIOS. So even if your hardware is fine, Windows will gaslight you and crash anyway.Here’s the kicker: \*\*I installed Linux Mint 21.3 Cinnamon, and it runs like buttery smooth. No crashes. No warnings.

Let me say that again: **Linux Mint is running Windows more stable than Windows itself can**.  
So yeah, I’m done. Microsoft turned a perfectly fine machine into e-waste with software. Linux Mint turned it into a productivity beast again. No forced updates. No telemetry. No random crashes.

"For someone who is using Windows for last 15 years, how to get started with Linux?","I will keep it short:

1. I am a non-tech person. I know only basic HTML, CSS.
2. Using windows from last 15 years as didn't have any other option.
3. Absolutely (times 100) hate windows.
4. I use my computer primarily for browsing, reading books, watching videos, blogging and secondarily for video/photo editing with Adobe tools.
5. I absolutely (times 100) hate windows.

I have heard lots of good things of Linux. It is fast, not buggy, starts, updates, shutdowns fast, doesn't hang much, etc. The only thing I have heard (can be wrong) is that it requires a ton of learning curve to do even basic things.

So, for my primary use case if I can use Linux without doing any coding (and then switch to that (sadly) windows for video editing)), I will consider it as win for me.

"Noobs of all operating systems, you need a backup of your important data","**TL;DR:** If you have files on your computer that you would be upset if you lost, you need to have them backed up somewhere.

A very common question on this sub is, “How do I install linux without losing my data?” The answer to this question is that you need to copy all your files to a different, preferably external, storage drive and then copy them back onto your computer once it’s running linux.

But wait, as far as things that could happen to your computer that would make you need external copies of your data go, installing linux should be the least of your worries. Installing linux is something that you choose to do and when it happens. There are an infinite number of things that could happen to your computer at any time, without notice, and without your permission that could make it so that you can’t use any of the data that is on it. If you don’t have a copy of your files somewhere else, it will be gone forever.

Backing up your data does not have to be difficult nor complex.

I imagine that the comments of this post are going to be full of very well meaning people who are going to encourage more robust backup strategy. If what they’re saying sounds like something you can and want to do, go for it, but don’t let perfect be the enemy of good. It is much more important that you make an external copy of your files now than it is that you implement the perfect backup solution tomorrow.","> It is much more important that you make an external copy of your files now than it is that you implement the perfect backup solution tomorrow.

You know, this is maybe a little OT but when one is thinking about backups one thing that I don't feel gets stressed nearly enough is the idea to make a backup of a config file before you hack at it so you can put things back the way they were before you started messing with them  :)

Almost every Linux text editor can be configured to make a backup of a file before any edits are saved and this has saved my backside probably a couple dozen times over the years.

Rule #1 - don't go someplace you can't get back from.  If you can put it back the way it was before you started messing with it you can  hack up pretty much anything you want without fear.

But yeah - your backup solution doesn't need to be perfect out of the gate, just get some kind of backup thing going and if you can, automate it so you don't have to worry about it.  You can always improve your backup solution as you learn, but getting stuff backed up is kind of a Big Deal.

Who has made the switch from windows and never looked back?,"I just wanted to know those who have made the switch to Linux from Windows 10 or 7 and have never looked back since.  What was the reasons why, do you find any limitations, struggles or things you dislike?  Also what distro did you choose and what do you use your system for?","I did

It was a struggle in the beginning, there were things I only knew how to do on Windows.
But once you get over the learning curve, it's a relieve to use Linux. There are things you can do mich easier and much more efficient to work with, at least for my use case."
"how did you teach yourself all this (configs, shell scripting, code, all that kernel stuff)?","Hello fellow noobs and mods and programmers alike,

I just became curious about how everybody out in cyberspace teaches themselves linux.  I know that different people have their own style of learning (be it verbal, kinesthetic, linguistic or whathave) and am simply wildly curious .. 

how did you learn the basics of programming?  what methods work and doesn't work for you?

because I'm considering keeping a notebook bc it6 takes me forever to figure anything out.  

thanks 

ps wrote my 1st she'll script yesterday for lemonbar. .. if only I could get the bar to stay in place fh","Honestly? Solving one problem at a time lol.

Each time I'm working along and I have that thought, you know the one, it goes something like:
""I wonder if I could...""
""Why can't I just...""
""All I want to do is...""


From those base quality of life annoyances, I end up down a rabbit hole of stack overflow and archwiki tabs and when I emerge, I've picked up another practical skill and understand another piece of how my Linux operating system works.

On the other hand, I feel like I have to state that knowing programing and kernal configuration is not necessary to enjoy our platform. Much like other operating systems, not all Linux users are ""power users"", it's just that all Linux power users have immense power over their system. If you are not interested in programming or the technical side, don't feel like you're not using Linux ""correctly"" :)"
I've officially been a Linux user for twelve hours.,"I'm taking a break from Windows 10 after a botched update or something left my system with performance roughly equivalent to that of a Tandy, so I installed Linux Mint Cinnamon as my first-time distro.

My experience so far has been... well, okay. Actually getting the bootable USB to work took a lot more trial and effort than I was expecting (""what the fuck is this GRUB thing?""), but I was surprised at how well pretty much everything from my dual monitors to my printer just instantly worked right away. Windows NEVER was able to properly detect my dual-monitor setup. Accessing and playing the files and music on my backed-up hard drive was also surprisingly effortless.

Right now I'm just getting used to stuff. Every FAQ, guide, and instruction manual seems to have a real hard on for the Terminal, which at the moment I don't have much interest in. The Panel is also taking some getting used to with its dizzying array of options and strange nomenclature (applet?). Finding software hasn't been too much of a challenge yet since I use a lot of web apps, but I'd like to find a decent alternative to Notepad++ as I'm an aspiring coder in training.

Eventually I will be going back to Windows 10 for gaming and other reasons, but I figured this was a good enough time to finally see what all the fuss was about in this Linux world. Y'all alright.","I'd recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/) ([ppa](https://launchpad.net/~webupd8team/+archive/ubuntu/atom/+index)) as a text editor. It's cross platform, well-supported, has great plugins, and free in every sense.

 

Terminal can get pretty complicated if you want it to, but if you're just doing updates it's pretty simple.

All you need to know is (and it's not as scary as it looks from the size of the block of text):

`sudo apt update` updates the list of software that can be upgraded
`sudo apt upgrade` installs software on that list of things you can update
`sudo apt install ______` installs an application (provided you have the repository added)
`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:_______` adds a repository (be conservative about doing that)

 

A repository is a place where you can download software and updates from. Think of the App Store or Google Play Store.

 

To update all software run `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`.
( `&&` means 'if X finishes successfully, run Y'.)

To install a program from the default repository run `sudo apt instal name-of-application`

To install multiple programs at once run `sudo apt instal name-of-application-1 name-of-application-2'

To install something from a third party repository run `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ppa/name && sudo apt update && sudo apt install name-of-application`

 

**Things to note:**

`sudo` gives you root privileges. You can break things if/when you start playing with it.
Whatever you do, **never** run `sudo rm -rf /`. That's the command to wipe your boot drive and all other mounted drives.

Sometimes linking to commands with `&&` can cause problems with will be solved by running one the other. It's rare, but it happens.

You probably shouldn't add PPAs that aren't from launchpad.net (unless it's the [Typora](http://www.typora.io/) one. Typora is amazing.)

I get that that might look like a lot, but that's 90% (I can't remember how to uninstall things and I have classes tomorrow morning) of what you need to know. The learning curve is a bit steep, but now that I understand it, I wish I could run software updates like this on my Mac. It's just tidy.

 

**Edit :** markdown is being grumpy on mobile. I'll fix it tomorrow. For now, excuse the backticks. If you see one, it shouldn't be there.

**Edit 2:** Fixed it.

**Edit 3:** Cleaned up style stuff and grammar. Added a bit based on comments."
I've had enough. I'm making the switch to Linux and open source/single purchase software.,"I am flashing PopOS to a USB drive as I type this...

I'm sitting here looking at my iPad mini 4, my iPad mini 2, and a slew of other perfectly serviceable electronics that have been rendered unusable because of planned obsolescence and locked down hardware. I'm contemplating the fact that I spend money each month to retain access to the same music, movies, audiobooks, and other media that I habitually and cyclically consume. I'm subscribing to creative software from companies like Adobe who roll out more anti-consumer practices by the day, it seems. 

I'm just done with this. So I'm making some decisions:

* I don't know anything about Linux, but I'm going to learn. 
* I don't know anything about Raspberry Pi projects, but I'm going to learn. 
* I don't know anything about 3D printing, but I'm going to learn.
* I haven't soldered anything or fiddled with electronics since my freshman year of high school in 1992, but I can learn those skills again, too. 

I'm going to learn how to make the technology I want. Technology that serves my needs and has positive uses beyond just being a product a company can sell to me every four years. I want devices that are sensible, upgradeable, and repairable... so I guess I'm going to have to freaking make them myself. That seems to be the trend I'm seeing in the tech world. 

I have a PC that I just recently built with the following components: 

* MSI B550 GEN3 Gaming Motherboard (AM4) 
* Ryzen 5 5600  
* Intel ARC A770 16GB  
* 16GB DDR4 3200 RAM
*  256gm NVME SSD

I'm gonna throw PopOS on here and start messing around. My Mac mini is my daily driver so I have the space to play around here with this machine. Ultimately, however, my goal is to migrate away from the Apple ecosystem as well. 

Wish me luck!","Welcome to the Linux gang, brotha.

You are going to need to learn new stuff, aswell as re-learn some others. There is plenty of resources out there, so you are not alone.

A few advice I can give:

+ Search before you ask. Many questions one may had have been already asked and answered, is it simply a google search away to find them. It is so easy, that in the Linux help forums it is considered bad etiquette to ask directly as it perceived as rude and lazy from your part. If none of the questions satisfies your particular needs, then you can ask
+ There are some people on the community that are professional gatekeepers. Bitter people that want Linux to be an elitis OS for the minority. Don't listen to them.
+ The terminal may seem daunting at first, but once you get the hand out of it, it does magic. But many thing in there can be done with graphical apps, so don't obsess with it.
+ For the most part Linux distributions don't matter, as you can run the same programs and do the same tasks in all of them. Some may provide some software in their repositories (or even preinstalled), but in the end Linux is Linux.

Do users always use terminal while using Linux?,"I am currently learning programming; I have seen people using Linux but mostly the terminal all the time. Usually learning all the commands like mkdir or rm. Why not just use the GUI? To like to delete or make directory. 

Most tutorials are usually just people using the terminal while using Linux. Do people just use terminal for performing operations?

Also is there some type of support channel or something where I can ask 'stupid' Linux questions without getting humiliated for not knowing stuff? Or maybe someone I can DM?","Always? Definitely not. 

Even if I could, I would rather use FileZilla than the terminal emulator to transfer data using sftp, for example.

In other cases, it depends on the individual case. Sometimes I use the terminal emulator and sometimes a graphical user interface for the same task. Depending on what mood I'm in.

In some cases I also combine Terminal Emulator and a graphical tool. For example, I use the Mercurial version control system. I do most things like hg commit, hg push etc. in the terminal emulator. For other functions, however, I prefer to use graphical tools such as TortoiseHg because I find it clearer.

In my opinion, you are only limiting yourself if you restrict yourself to one type of use. Because every solution has its advantages but also its disadvantages."

Switching to Linux for basic everyday use - without learning how it works… Is it possible?,"Hi everyone!

I’m thinking of switching to Linux rather than using Windows/Mac as I have done in the past, as a result of a friend saying I should give it a go after my ramblings about (what I see as) the Microsoft/Apple duopoly we have at the moment, followed up by reading a few articles about Linux online.

The problem is that I am a COMPLETE noob - I’m talking complete noob at not just Linux but computers in general! For example:

* I have no idea how a computer works aside from it has a computer unit and a graphics card
* I barely know what a driver is and wouldn’t know where to start in updating one
* I have never opened the command line on windows, and don’t even know what it really does
* If I get any error on my laptop (windows at the moment), then I will try to exit and ignore it, and failing that I will hold down the power button to restart and hope that fixes the problem (it always seems to have so far)
* I would prefer my laptop to either be super intuitive and natural to use (like I find Windows/Mac/iPad/my Android phone at the moment), or where needed to just tell me how to use it, rather than me needing to go and google everything every second!

That said I am a pretty intelligent guy (in things other than computer!), but the thing is I don’t really have a desire to learn about any of the above… I would say I would like to learn ***how to use*** Linux, but without learning ***how Linux works***. So basically use it in the same way I have used Windows/Mac for all these years - browsing, watching stuff, using office (or something similar), etc - without having to know about kernels and command lines and drivers etc, and have it all stay up to date and working automatically.

As a basic analogy: I want to buy a Linux car as an alternative to the market leaders and I want to learn how to use it, but I don’t have any interest in learning what is happening under the hood, how the engine is working or how to roll my sleeves up and fix it. Ideally it would be as bullet proof as possible and need very little maintaining after it’s set up!

After posting on the main r/linux forum I had a few replies that were encouraging, a few that said it wasn’t the right fit for me, and a few saying I was never going to find what I want if I didn’t want to learn (and a few saying that this attitude will mean a struggle with life lol). Then my post was deleted as it wasn’t a support forum, which is fair enough! Hopefully this is a more suitable place to post.

It‘s possible that Linux isn’t the right fit for me, but I would love to have thoughts from relative experts on if it would be possible to get Linux as the noob I currently am, and then to stay the noob I am now while using Linux for everyday stuff?

Thanks all! Please go easy on me - if I have I don’t mean to cause any offence!","Yes, you absolutely can. Get something beginner friendly like Mint or Fedora, and most stuff you need will be there already. If something doesn't work, both of those have great community support that will explain exactly what you need to do without having to know how it works or exactly what is being fixed. Also a quick google search will usually give you the answer for basic stuff. And if you can't fix it there, there's always this sub. It's definitely doable. 

Coming from Windows I would recommend Linux Mint - Cinnamon, as the user experience is much more similar to Windows than some others."
What is the best way to learn Linux?,"from books to youtube tutorials. Can someone tell me, what are the best resources to learn Linux?

I know it all comes down to practice and just exploring around. But I want to make my fundamentals strong. Any help will be appreciated! Thanks","Lots of easy to find documentation. But really.   


Install linux. Work your way around it. See what i can do. Look up things. Ask people - such as here or in one of the chats about linux ( like IRC )   
Then fuck up the system and start over. Youll learn. Dont worry."
"How do I make a linux ""app""","So on windows, making an exe is pretty straightforward, I download Visual Studio, use the backbones it provides and just fill in the gaps. But how do I do this for linux? Whenever I search into google it just tells me how to make a bash script, which not what I'm after. I want to make something that I could like publish to the apt repository, something that runs natively on linux, if that makes sense.","First you need to choose a language to write your program in. This could be bash, C, C++, golang, python, ruby, perl, java, etc.

Then you need to choose an editor, some are language specific. This can be a simple text editor in the GUI or command line like vi, nano, emacs. Or you could use an IDE like pycharm, intellij idea, visual studio (runs on linux too), gnome builder, codelite, etc.

After you have written your program and if you are using a compiled language that outputs a binary to execute (similar to an exe), then you need to compile your program with your build-time dependencies. Languages like python, perl and bash are interpreted and not compiled by the user, their programs are plain-text files and any dependencies must be installed by whoever is going to run them.

Now you need to package your program for distribution, this could be an rpm, deb, snap, flatpak, tarball. Depending on your choice any dependencies should be ""required"" or noted. If you are distributing a compiled program then it's important to note what OS and architecture it was built for.

Then you need to choose where to publish it, this can be github, your own private repo server, or a public repo."
Knowing what software to trust in the Linux world,"One of the aspects of Linux that has taken the most getting used to for me is also one of the most charming aspects. There is a huge community of volunteers/enthusiasts who put open source software and code out there for anyone to use, for free. But as someone coming from Windows and used to downloading software from ""official"" websites and trusted environments, I often find myself nervous and unsure whether open source software can be trusted. 

For example, when I first installed Linux on my PC, the wifi card did not work, and I had to download drivers for my specific Realtek card. Realtek themselves did not have the drivers available for Linux yet, but there were already open source drivers published on Github by this guy [Larry Finger](https://github.com/lwfinger), who apparently regularly uploads them for the community. I downloaded them, and they worked great.

But my question is--how do I know who the hell Larry Finger is, and that his Github page doesn't just have malware disguised as drivers? Does that ever happen, or am I paranoid? Do I need to know how to read the C programming language and read the source code, or how do you confirm the veracity of some of these repositories? Sorry if this is an extremely noob-type question.","Short answer:  You don't.  So, you do what you do in real life.  Ask.  Ask here. Ask on the community support website for your distro of choice (probably the best place to start), ask on umbrella sites like [linuxquestions.org](https://linuxquestions.org).   Be nice, ask politely, and you'll get usable feedback.

Beyond that, and in general, you can assume that anything that comes from your distro's repository has been vetted for malicious behavior and functionality.   GitHub and that other one (sorry, I forget) is reliable as well.  I've never had a problem with software from SourceForge (the site itself is another matter) but some will disagree and likely with reason. 

Beyond that, it's good to be cautious, but there's a lot of good software in places like :ppa repositories (Ubuntus) or the AUR (Arch family) that shouldn't be overlooked solely because it's user contributed.  If you're not sure about it, just ask."

"What are the core differences that make Debian and other distros, like Red Hat or Arch, really different at their roots?","Since I keep reading that every distro can be tweaked and personalized to look and behave however we want, I just wonder, once we remove the graphical interface and all the software, what makes a key distro like Debian really different than Red Hat? And why it is not possible to tweak Red Hat to the point that it is indistinguishable from Debian? Is it because of the kernel they use (whatever that is)? Or some other really deep way their code is written from scratch that cannot be changed?

Coming from Windows, the GUI is really a fundamental part of how an OS looks and behaves. But in Linux even that can be chosen, so I am just wondering what ""makes"" a different distro really DIFFERENT.

**Edit**: thanks for all the awesome replies, I can definitely say that everything is much more clear now about distros and how they are put together :)","Essentially the difference is how the distro is packaged. You can make your own essentially.

Linux is a quite small kernel. On top of that you pick and chose lots of different packages and systems. But it's all the same Linux when you boil it down.

Using a distro is really just a lazy way to let others make the framework for you.

Not that it's wrong mind you.

For example you might want Debian for servers as they are solid and stable. You want that.  For a desktop you might want Ubuntu as it's user friendly. And for development and testing you light want arc as it's the latest and thus gives you a better chance at finding bugs in current software.

But it's all still Linux."

Had my first reality check with linux today,"I started using Zorin a couple of weeks ago and by and large I have enjoyed it since switching from Windows, but today I hit my first real point of friction.

I thought I had done my research, but I never expected something as simple as printing would be so complicated. Not looking for help,  just ranting. The upshot is that now I know about cups and I can send documents to my printer. On the flip side, my wife still uses windows and she has never been able to print easily; she just puts up with having to power cycle her computer after hitting print. Anyway, thanks for listening to my TED talk","Unfortunately, it is like that sometimes.

Less and less, and I do think KDE and Valve are finally setting examples of ""*It shouldn't be hard to do something""*. But even on Zorin and Mint I had experiences with time that I just rolled my eyes in frustration.

I don't think here will welcome your growing pains (ironically), but if there is any consolation to it, sometimes I recall or see someone have a very stupid problem with windows, and it makes me glad I made the right choice. The latest one was with drivers, ironically enough, neither windows 10 or 11 the notebook I troubleshot would work with audio, but it was very much working because every single distro I tested had it out of the box.

Welcome to your new found freedom! I remember how I felt a couple years ago  (so dumb, for not having made the switch years earlier) when I quit macOS for Debian. No going back, as far as I'm concerned. 

BTW, prepare yourself for a shock: as good as it is (and it is good), Gnome is probably the least configurable desktop out-of-the-box.

I’m a Data Scientist and use python mostly at work. I had a python package conflict between pip and Conda and so my idea to fix it as to completely uninstall python and reinstall it with only the packages I need. 

Turns out the Gnome desktop environment is largely written in python so I broke my work computer. ~~Only solution is to reinstall Ubuntu.~~

TL;DR never uninstalled python on Gnome if you don’t want to break everything","Tip - if the list of packages to uninstall is longer than half a screen when you only asked to remove one or two, you *probably* don't want to press that confirmation...

"Hi noobs! I'm creating a completely free Linux class for those wishing to learn Linux, and, in the future, web development. I need your feedback.","First, you can join me in [Hangouts](https://talkgadget.google.com/hangouts/_/tqhyz4mpa7yhn5bjgih5nicxy4a) if you want to discuss live. I'll be there for about an hour, or whenever my wife wakes up.

I created [a subreddit for the class](/r/linuxclass), so if you're interested, head there, read my post, and subscribe for updates.

A little background info about me: I'm currently a software engineer, with ~15 years experience as a sys admin. I've been working with Linux since 1998, when everything was really difficult. I've been teaching a few people Linux 1-on-1, and found that I *really* enjoy it. I've decided that I'd like to teach more people.

My intention in doing this class is to take people from knowing nothing about Linux, to being able to work as a sys admin. We'll work with many distros, services, AWS, etc. I'm going to start with the basics (e.g., `ls`, the filesystem, etc), and move into more advanced topics. For the first part of the class, I'm basically following the outline for the RHCE certification exam.

After Linux has been learned, I plan on setting up an environment for web apps, using Docker, Nginx, etc. We will then move into development of a web app.

My questions:

1. Does anyone know a platform where I can teach (others watch), and if people have questions they can queue up. Then, when I am ready to take questions, I can go through the queue of people and let them ask. The biggest thing I want is the ability to take questions in an organized fashion.

2. Anyone who has ever tried to learn Linux, or wants to know more about it, what topics would you like to see covered? I'm really interested in feedback here. I'd like to know what aspects people would like to learn.

3. For the web app, any ideas on a fun, and relatively easy, web app that we could create together would be awesome. I was thinking about making a Reddit clone, but I'm really open to ideas.

Any feedback is really appreciated. I'm creating the syllabus at this point, and the feedback I receive here will help me in shaping the syllabus.

Thanks all.

EDIT: Like an idiot, I deleted my very informative post. I am rewriting it on the subreddit right now.

EDIT2: My wife is awake. Nobody joined me in hangouts. I'd really like to test it, so if anyone wants to join me this evening send me a PM and we can set up a time. I'm heading to get some brunch now, so I'll be back in a bit.

Please share this with subreddits or people you'd think might be interested. I really want as many people to see this as possible. If there are too many people, I will set up multiple sessions a week, or figure something out. Thanks to everyone who helps me out :)","Thank you very much for doing this. I have been interested in linux for so long I just couldn't find the time to really dive into it, so I'm planning to go through with this. As for your questions:

1. You could try [twitch.tv](http://twitch.tv) which is primarily used for gaming but has recently begun to be used for teaching development and other things. Checkout [Hand Made Hero](http://handmadehero.org), they use twitch and it is very good in my opinion. There are some problems with twitch or with live streaming in general, like timezones, but I guess the lessons could be recorded and posted to youtube (like hand made hero).

1. I don't have  any good ideas for a web app but a reddit clone sounds cool.

I'm done with windows 10 and I want to switch over to Ubuntu.,"I am a programmer and am comfortable with command line. I have used windows from my fourth grade. Now I have an Acer laptop (Acer Aspire A515 - 51G) and I want to install Ubuntu (A complete Fresh install, not a dual booted one). Anyone please guide me so that I don't run into hardware errors (touchpad, wifi , lan or bluetooth issues) and Compatibility issues.","Idk why people are advising you to check anything. All you need is a USB stick. Just go download an Ubuntu (or Mint) live image, use a tool like Rufus to write the image to the USB stick, and then boot from the USB stick. Go for it.

Voila, you're running Linux, and you haven't touched your existing Windows installation at all. Yet.

Now, check if your touchpad works, check if you have network connectivity (i.e. click the Firefox icon), if you get sound when playing a random Youtube video, if the screen resolution looks right and scrolling is smooth, and so on.

If it all works, that means the Linux version you're running supports your hardware. Next step would be actually installing it, setting up partitions and (optionally, but I'd recommend it) a dual-boot environment and so on. You'll be installing exactly the same version as the live image you're running, so you'll know what to expect in terms of compatibility.

If something doesn't work in the live environment you may need a newer version of the kernel (to get the latest driver set) or even some manual device setup. Ask about the problem here before installing if that's the case."
What are some small things that changed how you use Linux?,"Like for me, it was knowing 
- What PATH and .bashrc is how you can manipulate them to your advantage
- I can make aliases on terminal. 
- I can source control my .bashrc and other important dot files, so that I can change them without worries and transfer them
- And that of it's a git repo, theme if the terminal can be changed
- Using workspaces

"I love Linux, but I often don’t know what to do after booting up","Hey everyone,

I've noticed something interesting: When I boot into Windows, I always find something to do – even if I have no plan. Games, YouTube, random tweaks... there's always *something*.

But when I log into Linux (Arch in my case), I often sit there staring at my beautiful desktop and think: ""Okay, now what?""

I love Linux, I enjoy customizing it, and I’ve already set up quite a bit (Waybar, fonts, etc.). But without a specific goal, I often feel kind of... lost? Like I’m missing an entry point into my day.

Has anyone else experienced this?

Do you have routines, scripts, dashboards, or tips that help you use Linux more intentionally or creatively?

Should I put my elderly mom on Linux?,"Now before I get hit with the ""dumbass Linux can get viruses aswell"" I know this, but weekly I'm getting calls from my mom about her having viruses on her windows 11 laptop, but Linux gets less... Way less viruses. 

My mom browses the web, she plays a few mobile games on her computer(android emulation), uses Facebook... And as far as I know that's about it. So I have no clue where her viruses are coming from, but last time she had a virus it had a crypto virus on it and wiped her files unless she paid money. 

And then there's the argument of ""just get an anti virus"" the problem with that is she's already complaining about how slow the laptop is... I feel like this would kill 2 birds with 1 stone, but your thoughts?","I'd suggest Linux Mint because Mint is well-designed, relatively easy to install, learn and use, stable, secure, backed by a large community, and has good documentation. Mint's default Cinnamon desktop environment is similar to Windows, and that might cut down on the learning/adjustment curve a bit and provide a familiar working environment. 

I've used Linux for close to two decades and moved to LMDE 6 (Linux Mint Debian Edition) because at age 78 I've come to value simplicity and stability.  In the 8-9 months I've been using Mint, I've not had a single glitch or touched the command line.

Mint is about as ""no fuss, no muss, no thrills, no chills"" as it gets with Linux distributions.  I can recommend Mint without reservation as an appropriate distribution for non-technical, older users. 

If your mother uses the Chrome browser, and is ""already complaining about how slow the laptop is"", you might also consider buying your mother a Chromebook.

I mention this because several of my friends (we range in age from 74 to 80) migrated from Windows laptops to Chromebooks at the suggestion of their grandchildren (who grew up with Chromebooks in school), and all who did so are delighted to have made the switch.

I've had enough experience with Chromebooks to understand why.  ChromeOS is simple (almost intuitive) to use, almost impossible for a user to screw up, is stable, updates flawlessly without user intervention, is very secure, is good fit for a Chrome-based use case and has good Android integration through the Play Store.

If your mother already uses Chrome as her browser, a Chromebook might be a good fit for her.

ChromeOS Flex (which essentially turns a Windows laptop into a Chromebook) might be an option, but not an option I would recommend given your mother's use case.  ChromeOS Flex is designed as a tool to assist large businesses to migrate from Windows to ChromeOS without disrupting hardware replacement cycles, and does not support Android or the Play Store."

Run powertop and watch the discharge rate. I measured idle and under load wattages.

* Optimize with PowerTOP
* Install/Configure TLP and TLP RDW
* Install/Configure Slimbook Battery

# Testing
Comparing pre-optimization power consumption to post optimization with powertop.

* I get a 25% power consumption reduction when idling with only a terminal open
* 56% power consumption reduction when under heavy load

"Why do ARM computers need ISOs for each specific one, but x86/x86_64 computers (normal laptops and desktops) can just use a universal iso to boot from?","I know ARM is a different CPU architecture than x86, but I'm really not sure why there's no ""Universal"" iso for it unlike x86.","All the replies so far haven't mentioned the main reason for this. 

ARM doesn't really have hardware detection like x86 does. This means that you can't create an image with all the drivers, and the correct ones are loaded as needed. Instead, you need to create a device tree that describes a device's hardware so you can generate a kernel image for it.

Recommendations of projects to do to learn more of Linux,"I started using Ubuntu about a year ago, and I've loved the experience. Unfortunately, because most of what I do is either in a browser or a Jupyter notebook, I don't really end up learning much more about Linux than the basics. For example, I decided to try to learn more about grep, sed, and awk right now, but the reality is that I don't have much superuser-type need to be performing crazy things on the command line. The best idea I've had to mess around with sed, for example, is to pipe the contents of `apt list -u` into sed to put each description on its own line.

Does anyone have recommendations of superuser-type projects that I could do to stretch my skills and expand my knowledge? Just silly things that someone who uses Linux might do for any reason, like basic sys admin type of stuff that you might pawn off on an intern.","Install another distro. Not required though.

- learn vim or emacs
- learn shell scripting basics (for small 5 - 20 lines)
- convert your bash scripts into POSIX shell scripts so it works on all systems
- setup some kind of web server or database (apache, nginx, mysql, postgresql)
- setup your own git server (many things dont need to be on the public github type site)
- complete the wargame called `bandit` at https://overthewire.org/wargames/
- setup a simple cronjob
- try out `clonezilla` to backup your entire linux distro. Then restore it.

Check out Tom Hudson showing off what you can do with `vim`. He's an expert in cyber security showing how you can use the exclamation mark '!' to run shell commands inside of vim. And even output the results back into your vim file/buffer.

Pleasantly Surprised by Linux Mint,"Hi everyone.  
We have a second-hand HP laptop at home with plenty of life left that was for some reason struggling on Win 10. My S.O bought it for gaming as his MacBook was having issue after issue but this laptop seemed to struggle playing Civ 5 (his favourite game) and so it was never really used and began gathering dust.  
I've been a heavy OSX user for several years but about 18 months ago drenched my MacBook in coffee and couldn't afford a replacement - I bought a cheap Acer laptop to fill the gap. The laptop is already falling apart and Win 10 is hateful.  
Well yesterday I installed Linux Mint on the HP laptop and it works and looks amazingly well. We have both been impressed by the ease of install and setup - in fact I'm typing this on it right now!  
Researching what distro to try reminded me of all the awesome folk out there operating in the open-source and Linux space and that outcomes can be SO much better taking the DIY road.  
We are not power-users at all and I think Linux Mint will be just fine for us.

"My ""secure"" debian server ended up getting hacked","So somehow attackers managed to compromise my dedicated hetzner server, besides common security measures. The infection was noticed only after monitoring a huge spike in cpu usage due to a crypto miner, disguised as a ""logrotate"" process.

After investigation, i found a payload hidden in the .bashrc of a non-root user:

[Payload found in .bashrc](https://preview.redd.it/d2obl0fmm27c1.png?width=1246&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce99677d4fe072042dab8ccf5959f8e50534520e)

The downloaded script tries to hijack (or if non-root disguise as a fake) logrotate systemd service and continues to download further malware.

[Snipped of the malicous script](https://preview.redd.it/nnj5e9zno27c1.png?width=2172&format=png&auto=webp&s=f54beb0de8bd86ad8708fafb48c1d15ce0e631ff)

In my case it downloaded some xmrig miner into \`./config/logrotate\`-

I have no clue how this happened. I took a bunch of common security measures, including

* Using a strong ed25519 ssh key for login
* Non default ssh port
* Disabling password auth / only allowing key auth
* Rate limiting ssh connections to prevent bruteforce
* Kernel + hoster grade firewall blocking all incomming ports besides ssh, mc and https services
* Up to date system packages (still running debian buster tho)

I don't even run exotic software on the compromised user. Really only a minecraft server. Other users are running nginx, pterodactyl, databases and docker containers.

At first, i suspected one of my clients to be infected and spread via ssh to the server, but after careful investigation i couldn't find any evidence of a compromised client.

The logs seem to say nothing about the incident, probably because the script has \`>/dev/null 2>&1\` appended to all commands.

Suspecting the minecraft server seemed obvious at this point. However, i run very popular software (Bungeecord, CloudNet, Spigot) and plugins (ViaVersion, Spark, Luckperms) that are also installed on many other minecraft servers. They all have the latest security patches, ruling out log4shell. A vulnerability there is unlikely for me.

I'm going to wiping the server and installing everything from scratch, but before i would like to know how the server was compromised so i can take actions to prevent this from happening again.

Can anyone of you share some thoughts or advice how to continue the investigation. Is this kind of virus known to you? Help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!

&#x200B;","Its very likely a flaw in something other than login/ssh security. My suspect would be the minecraft server.

Am I using Linux for the wrong reason?,"I started using Linux a few weeks ago because I wanted to have more control over my system. I hate it, that windows basically does what ever it wants, and you can't control much stuff. Linux is open source and I have read that you can customize almost everything (or even literally everything on some distros). So I thought Linux gives me more control over my system, and lets me know what my computer does.

But now, after a few weeks of using it, I still don't feel like I am an admin on my own computer. There are so many package types, which I don't know what they do exactly. I install software, but I don't know where it installs the software exactly. I don't even know how to remove software properly. When I want to uninstall something, I delete all folders I can find, but there could be more which I'm not aware of. Windows at least gave me the option to delete everything I want in the control panel.

Also, there are thousands of tasks running in the system monitor, and I don't know what they all do.

I thought Linux is better to control, and basically makes me the admin of my own system instead of the user of a product. But it seems like Linux is even more complicated, and hard to use.

Am I using Linux for the wrong reason?

I use Linux Mint btw.

Edit: Thanks for all your answers, you guys are incredibly helpful. I didnt respond to everything but I have read everything

Edit 2: I switched to arch now, and I like it much more. Arch makes you actually learn something about linux, of course you can also do that on other distros, but arch more or less forces you to learn something, in order to make your system run properly.","Having more control != easier. Think of a light switch. On/off would be Windows. A dimmer would give you more control, but now you need to make decisions about just how much light you want.

Is Linux more secure than Windows and Mac? How does it ensure safety and privacy?,One of the majoe reasons why I'm interested in Linux is because I am highly dissatisfied with many features of Windows 10. I've heard great reviews about Linux but I'm still skeptical.  Wouldn't Windows and Mac be more secure since they have closed source system instead of open source? How does Linux ensure security and user privacy?,"There are many reasons but I will touch on the main one you just asked about.

You are thinking that because they are closed source that no one can make changes. That is a fallacy. Many mal-actors reverse engineer and debug the code then make changes. You don't know what those changes are and unless you also reverse engineer or debug you would have trouble finding/fixing the bugs/malicious code.

Open source on the other hand is open. Many people have eyes on the contents of the code. It can be reviewed, disected, tested, reviewed, etc. When someone makes a malicious change or even and inadvertent accidental change, or a bug gets introduced, etc. the community at large works to eradicate the issue. 

There is no corporate monolith hiding behind their lawyers, NDAs etc.

There are bugs in Windows right now. Are they working on said bug? Any evidence? There are bugs/issues in linux kernel and associated packages, wanna know if they are being worked on? The source code is on the net, the repositories, pull requests, submits, commits, etc are all there for the world to see, review, vet, disapprove, approve."
Finally managed to switch to Linux full-time!,"I just wanted to share a success story with you.

I have been meddling with Linux (Debian-based distros mostly) for over 10 years, but for one reason or the other (sound problems, wi-fi drivers missing, inability to use a Windows program necessary to me) I had never been able to switch to Linux full-time.

After having Windows crash on me one more time (8GB of RAM are not enough when the OS is using 3 of them with no programs open...) I decided to format my SSD and give a try to Ubuntu 18.04.

My main tasks are:

- Programming and design (LEMP, Python, VS Code, GIMP)

- Gaming (League of Legends, Steam games, Football Manager)

- Music production (FL Studio + VSTis)

I am glad to let you know that everything is working fine! I had some trouble with League of Legends (low FPS until I started using the Vulcan drivers on Lutris) and audio drivers (I have a Focusrite Scarlett 2i4, but everything was solved with Jack and WineASIO on FL Studio). Many Steam games work out of the box and those that don't have still great performance via Wine.

If you are thinking about finally making the switch, give it a try! I didn't think it would be possible but it feels great to be able to use Ubuntu (and to have ditched Windows!).

- CPU: Intel i3-4160

Is Linux more reliable than Windows 10?,"I have Minecraft world me and my friends have been working on for over a year now. I've been hosting it on windows 10, but today my windows account on my PC got corrupted and would only show black for some reason. All my research leads me to believe that, that's just a thing that can happen for no reason sometimes, it also may have been because I wasn't using a Microsoft account which is total BS if I lose all my stuff just because I'm using a different email. Thankfully I was able to get a backup of the world working and only lost a few days of progress, but I really don't want this to happen again and I'm wondering if it's even worth risking it if windows just does this with no way to prevent it. So my question is, is Linux more reliable for gaming? Will it be safer for me to just install Linux so I there's a lower chance of losing my world? I understand corruption happens sometimes, and there's not always a lot you can do about it, but I really don't want to risk losing everything just because windows is unreliable","If you use a LTS version of a Linux distribution, then yes, Linux is more stable than Windows.

How to Utilize Linux to Prepare Me for the Cyber Security World,"Hey everyone!
I've been using windows for nearly 15 years, but everything in the Cyber Security world is Linux-based. So my question is where to start in building a solid foundation for myself later on? I have no idea where to start with using Linux, or how to use it for particular purposes. I need to become proficient in Linux so I can branch out into the Admin or PenTest worlds, so I figured this thread is the best place to start for initial guidance.

"What is kde, plasma, gnome, and xfce?","I’ve heard these terms on the manjaro website, could anybody explain them to me? Thanks for any help!","To put it another way:
When looking at Windows, look at all the components which make up your ""desktop"": the start menu, the task bar (""panel""), the system tray, the clock/calendar, the window decorations/borders/buttons, the icons on the desktop, the wallpaper, any desktop widgets, and also additional programs which can be categorized as ""system"" or ""basic"" like the file manager, a tool to extract archives, a calculator, a basic editor, and things like that.
These are all programs which make up your desktop environment. In Windows, there's just one default for each (provided by Microsoft).

In Linux, because it's an open system where anyone can create anything, there's a multitude of different desktops available, all with different pros and cons, and distributions often ship with several to choose from, because it's one of the most important choices that users make about their Linux desktop system. KDE (= Plasma), Gnome and XFCE are 3 of the most popular desktop environments under Linux. There are even more than that. ""KDE Plasma"" and Cinnamon are (by default) very Windows-like. Gnome is (by default) rather OS X like. XFCE is for people wanting a lightweight / less featureful DE. Most DEs allow for high degrees of customization, meaning you can customize their look+feel by a lot (much more than you're used to in Windows)."
How do I explain to someone that something open source can be secure?,"I just had an argument with my friend who doesn't really understand open source things about how even though Linux is open source it's also secure. My friend was saying that Linux couldn't be safe because people could just look at security and just get around it. I tried explaining to him how because it's open source millions of people constantly have their eyes on it and constantly checking every commit, release, etc to make sure it's safe, but he just said that you could still just get around those just by looking at the code and coding a bit. Is there a simple (think eli5 but just the tiniest bit more complex) way to tell him that something can be open source and safe / secure?","Everyone knows how a key and lock works, yet we all rely on it to secure our homes."

Moving to Linux has been extremely frustrating,"My old Macbook is finally dying, and I've been getting pretty fed up with Apple, so I figured I would make the switch to desktop Linux. I have little prior experience with Linux, but I'm a reasonably technically savvy person in general; I do some personal web development and have set up simple Linux VPSs, know how to use the command line, etc.

I saw Ubuntu recommended as the most polished and beginner-friendly distro, so I went with that. It has not gone well. A brief list of issues I've encountered:

\* There's some bug with Nvida graphics cards that causes noticeable mouse lag on my second monitor, along with freezes whenever I do something that's graphics-intensive.

\* Even with no second monitor in use, sometimes Ubuntu will just randomly freeze while I'm playing a game.

\* Sometimes when I close the laptop and reopen it, it has crashed.

\* Ubuntu's recommended browser of Firefox is extremely slow at some tasks, practically unusable. I tried switching to Chrome, but Chrome has its own intermittent freezes, and there's some bug where a tab can get ""stuck"" while I'm moving it and prevent me from continuing to move it.

\* There's a bug that causes my mouse to get stuck when I move it from one display to the other if it's too close to the top of the screen.

\* I had hoped that moving to Linux would give me more customization options, but it appears the breadth of tools available is quite poor. For example I was looking for a simple backup utility that would function similarly to Time Machine on Mac, and it appears there are none. Reading old threads on other people asking for the same thing, I see a bunch of Linux users recommending things that are not similar at all, or saying ""oh you can easily emulate that by writing your own bash script"". Like, sure, I am capable of doing that, but when users are having to write their own solutions to simple tasks it's obvious that the existing app repository is insufficient for its core purpose. I also tried to find a simple image-editing program like Preview on Mac, and there was nothing; I can either pick between Gimp with its extremely high learning curve or various other programs that are covered in visual bugs and can't even do something like ""drag corner to resize image"".

\* Opening Steam can take more than 30 seconds, and then I have to wait another 30+ seconds for an actual game to open. Even opening the terminal sometimes forces me to wait for multiple seconds.

\* Most concerningly of all, it appears that the Snap store has no human review, and [frequently contains malware](https://forum.level1techs.com/t/malware-in-the-snap-store-again/208817)? And that Canonical claims that individual Snaps are sandboxed, but this is actually not true, and even a ""strict mode"" snap can [run a system-wide keylogger](https://www.aquasec.com/blog/snap-trap-the-hidden-dangers-within-ubuntus-package-suggestion-system)? Frankly: what the *hell* guys?

And all of this in less than a week. I can only imagine how many more issues I would discover in the years that I would like to use this laptop.

Like, I'm really trying here. I love the ethos behind open-source, and I'm willing to do a bit of extra config work and suffer through some minor inconveniences to use Linux as my default OS. (I didn't mention the dozens of more minor issues I've come across while trying to get my system set up.) But as it currently stands, it just doesn't feel like Linux (or at least Ubuntu) is actually ready for practical use as a desktop environment by people who want to spend their time doing things other than debugging Linux issues.

Have I just had a uniquely bad experience here? Maybe some of these are hardware issues, I should buy a new computer, switch to a different distro, and try again? Or is this just the best that's to be expected from the Linux ecosystem right now, and I should suck it up and buy another overpriced Macbook? I don't know whether my experience here is representative, I would appreciate hearing from others who are also just trying to use Linux as a practical work and leisure environment.",This might be an Ubuntu issue and if that's a case then I would give Linux Mint a try.  If that is still not fulfilling your needs then mayhaps Linux is really not for you and that's totally ok.  It's not for everyone.

How to use Linux *well*?,"A little about me (for context):

I'm a CompSci student in my early 20s. Used Windows since 8 years old. 3 months ago switched to linux - distro hopped between Ubuntu, PopOS and Arch (current). Broke kernels and a lot of other stuff. Currently diving deep into the r/unixporn.

My linux experience, generally, was frustrating. I didn't have a clear reason to switch - I guess I believed becoming a total geek is useful. I wanted to dive deep into this world of absolute customization, hoping I will figure out what I want along the way.

..except, I never did. I learned bash scripting, advanced desktop environment customization, kernels etc. All of these still feel like they're unrelated topics - topics that will certainly make me more knowledgeable about Linux, but that won't help me *be more productive with computers* in a significant way.

In other words: I probably can figure out answers to following questions:

* Which window manager is better: auto-tilling or manual one?
* Should I keep using GUI basic apps (like file manager, system monitor, app manager) or go full Vim/emacs/bash?

..but I can't figure out how all of this will help me to use my computer better.

 Is it a goal worth pursuing or am I being too perfectionist? Is that a thing - a *good way to use computer*? Or is it a highly personal thing? Why these *big questions* seem to be covered so much less than straightforward, low-level questions?

Very noob question but why do we need sudo command,"Like I said, this is a very noob question but I had to ask it. Why do we need the sudo command, if we have the ability to do something we weren’t able to do by just typing sudo, why not have the ability to do that in the first place?","Its a good question. Its quite simple. Its to prevent programs or scripts from just doing whatever without you knowing what it is. 

If youre going to make a systemwide change youll want to make sure that whoever issues that command has the rights to do so. By invoking sudo it requires your password to be entered. That is not something a program or script can just do on its own. 

Windows later did something similar by having a popup that no program is allowed to interact with, it needs you to click OK to proceed.   
Sudo is pretty much same thing only its asking for the password of a user who have rights to act on behalf of root. Which is what sudo is - it stands for ""Super User DO"".  Its essentially equivalent to ""The king orders"" Which is also why it doesnt tell you that it did what you asked. If it doesnt throw up any errors then it did what you asked it to. And if you asked it to burn your system then thats what it did.  With great powers and so on..."

Thanks to this sub I finally managed to ditch Windows and settle with a distro that works for my needs and my GPU!,"It's been a wild week! 

After I decided to switch from Windows 10 to Windows 11 it took me less than a day to realize that I'm not going to switch to 11. Not only that, but I decided to ditch 10 entirely. I've been learning web development using WSL2 as my terminal and it was about time to start using the real thing.

But there were problems or rather THE problem. Nvidia's proprietary drivers. Without them, the performance sucks. With them, I was getting issues ranging from color problems to high CPU usage for watching [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) on Chrome or Firefox. At first I went with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and googling on how to fix things was giving me results that said ""this is how you enable hardware acceleration but it doesn't work with Nvidia unless it's nouveau"". Great. 

To keep it short, after 3 days someone linked me the arch wiki and I thought to myself ""why not just go arch and be done with it?""

After going through a lot of Distros the last couple years I have bitten the bullet and finally tried Mint. Wow!,"Dont know how many distros I have hopped over the last 2 years. Mostly debian/ubuntu bases. A number of different machines, and different purposes (server, work laptop, family desktop, pi, media machines, etc). I had kind of thought I had found a keeper with Xubuntu, as I was really happy with XFCE and with the general setup of it.

I kept seeing on various Linux subs I am in people recommending Mint to new users. I had used mint as in had a quick glance at it many times over the years, and had never really taken to it. TBQH I didnt see why all the fuss, but it had been a number of years since I used it.

After a while it became pretty obvious there was a pretty strong concensus for Mint in these kind of threads so I bit the bullet and put it in a VM to have a look. I figured if there were so many people recommending it there must be something to it.

Its so nice. What I notice is its super easy to use, the cinnamon desktop looks very polished (xfce is pretty clunky in a lot of respects - I say this with affection) but the real clincher was just how intuitive and well set up it is. I had the desktop set up in a matter of minutes. Everything was to hand and so well thought out. Its like they took the work Ubuntu have done on a great base os and then put a really superb interface on top of it. I guess thats what it is.

* 1: On one hand, Linus Torvalds himself admitted that he was approached by the US government to add a backdoor. We don’t know the outcome of that encounter.
* 2: On the other hand, there are mechanisms to embed malicious code in opensource, as proved by Ken Thomson since 1984, even if someone does review the code, by just changing the compiler ([http://www.ece.cmu.edu/\~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf)).
* 3: Last, a lot of backdoors can be in the form of very subtle bugs in the software, that depend on timing and weird conditions that are almost impossible to catch. Since NSA contributed themselves software into the kernel (SELinux) they have more than opportunity. END

i strongly doubt it, but i wanted to ask what you guys think, do you think linux is backdoored by the NSA? if it is, then i have done a whole lotta work for nothing lol","Honestly, they dont need to forcibly insert a backdoor.

Gifted laptop with Linux Mint by an uncle by I'm a caveman and don't really understand what I'm doing. Want to do a fresh start on it.,"So one of my uncles recently gifted me a vizio laptop (dunno what kind since for the life of me I can't find a model number or something) that has Linux Mint 18.3 Cinnamon 64-bit on it. I want to actually keep using Linux considering my natural dislike of Windows 10 and Microsoft, but currently all I've tried doing has been a bust. 

I've tried to update to Linux 20 via first a USB with an ISO image of it, but the option to boot from it never appeared when I reboot. I then tried to update from 18.3 to 19 (to hopefully and progressively go from 19 to 19.3 and then finally to 20), but no dice there either and I had to kill the process (luckily used Timeshift and restored to right before I did any of the process). I then tried to simply change the computer name and username (since both were still his) to something of my choosing but even then I got confused and held off of it. Currently I'm now looking into just wiping the drive completely clean and reinstall 18.3.   


Am I being too hasty with this? I've tried looking at videos and tutorials but when I try to them do them things go awry or just not anywhere at all. So I just try to further familiarize myself with Linux first? For anyone that is wondering, what I saw in what I believe was my BIOS, my original OS on this system was Windows 8.","What you need to do is boot onto your Linux Mint 20 flash drive.

There are a few settings you can look for:

1. Enable USB booting (required if the option is given to you)
2. Disable Secure Boot (highly recommended for less headaches in the future)
3. Change the boot order so that your flash drive is at the top of the list (optional if you have access to a boot menu)"

However recently I’ve run into the thought of Linux as my os... my main reason for this is im a beginner in code and I like trying out different things so I decided to try linux since it open source etc. I make Minecraft videos and I know that Linux runs Minecraft and obs and that stuff so I’m not concerned about that. I’m concerned about editing... I use premiere pro right now and it seems you can’t port that to Linux so... is going to Linux the right thing and so I switch to a different editing software or is there a way to port adobe products? Also any general noob advice would be appreciated :)","One thing you need to remember. Do not download software from the internet unless you cannot find another way to do it. Here is Linux land we use package managers (like the Windows store, but it has the stuff you need)"
I think I instructed Ubuntu to delete itself.,"So, apparently, being the idiot I am, I just instructed Ubuntu to delete itself (or a big part of it).

The magical command was:

*sudo apt purge python3.6**

Not sure if it’s just me or just how Linux is but I find it frustrating sometimes to get simple things to work,"Ok so I installed Linux mint on my laptop a few months ago because it’s really old (9 years) and I was also curious about learning more about Linux. 

I’ve actually really enjoyed having it, and learning more about Linux commands and such.  The main thing that bothers me is that sometimes I have to work extra hard for programs to work.  

I remember researching Linux and people said they love how easy it is to install new programs because you can install everything in the terminal. Well I’ve had the exact opposite experience.  It seems every program I install has a completely new way to install it.  Sometimes from the terminal, sometimes installing a .deb, sometimes from the software manager, sometimes an appImage, and sometimes a PPA.  Very inconsistent. 

Also i find myself having to play around a lot to get programs to work right away.  Messing with settings and such.  Not a huge deal and I’ll keep using it as it’s not my main computer but I’m wondering if others have had the same experience. I think if I had it on my main PC I’d be wasting a lot more time getting things running on a daily basis.  Thanks!","> It seems every program I install has a completely new way to install it.

A few more ways you didn't mention:

- Flatpak

- Snap

- Docker

- compile from source

And some features of some apps don't work if you use one way or another.  I've had bad luck with Flatpak and Snap forms of apps that need to communicate to another app (browser, or helper app), for example."
What is this symbol: ' | '?,"What is it? What does it do?

edit: How do I type it too? (I copy-pasted that symbol)","> What is it? What does it do?

In terminal activities and some shell scripts, the '|' symbol is used to connect one process to another, sort of like a pipe connecting two streams. So it's called a 'pipe'.

Here's an example. If I say:

    $ for n in {1..10}; do echo $RANDOM; done

     20034
     24315
     12703
     22240
     10073
     18561
     20058
     5761
     8550
     12705

This prints a list of 10 random numbers. But suppose I want the list sorted -- I add a pipe and a sort command:

    $ for n in {1..10}; do echo $RANDOM; done | sort -n

     5761
     8550
     10073
     12703
     12705
     18561
     20034
     20058
     22240
     24315

So my original random-generating routine's output is delivered to the pipe, which serves as the input to 'sort'. One can say the numbers are 'piped' to a separate process. This piping method can be repeated as often as necessary, and one can use this to build complex and sophisticated sequences of commands."
"Part 2 of ""Want to move to Linux from Windows but need advice"" thread, a follow up","Hello everyone, I was requested to make a follow up to [my previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/kbdax5/want_to_move_to_linux_from_windows_but_need_advice/) where I sought advice about migrating to Linux from Windows 10 and I ended up with over a hundred comments, it was pretty crazy how much advice I got and Im really grateful for it. Im already on Linux atm and its been relatively smooth so far, Im having a lot of fun getting used to it.

I decided on Pop!\_OS as my first Linux distro, in a dual boot setup with Windows 10. Tbh I wanted to nuke Windows but the possibility of certain programs/games not working made me feel like I should keep Windows just in case. I bought a new SSD that was at a decent price with the intention of using it for Linux exclusively, it was kind of a pain in the ass getting the drive and the cables as I couldnt get them delivered from the store I bought them from and actually installing the drive was a huge pain in the ass because my PC's power supply is non-modular so I had to change the layout of all my drives and the cable management to fit them in, and it was also annoying finding the screws that came with the case to mount them.

Next I initialised the drives, and I initialised it as GPT not knowing that would be an issue, I would later have to change that. I made a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/pop_os/comments/kdv4iq/how_to_install_on_a_new_ssd_drive/) on the Pop!\_OS subreddit and ended up getting some really good help, but long story short I followed [this videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4BlW9rH8WA) instructions and had very few issues with installing Pop!\_OS.

After setting up my profile and all that jazz I started installing things from the Pop Shop, no issues there and a fair few of the applications I use were just on there. Pop shop seems kinda laggy but on the whole it was really easy to use. I was afraid the impression I had of the pop shop represented Pop!\_OS as a whole but it was surprisingly very smooth, it feels really snappy compared to Windows for sure.

I did have a few issues installing NordVPN and Brave Browser today but after some searching and following instructions I figured it out eventually. I feel like hackerman every time I do anything in the terminal lol. Ive basically been spending all of today messing around with stuff, setting up my accounts and tweaking things, and just testing how I felt doing everyday tasks. Tbh it feels really great and Ive actually found it quite fun just using whereas Windows always just feels bloated and frustrating to me, personally. I had an audio issue but I fixed it pretty easily, other than that Ive had no issues at all. I also followed an article on the System76 to customise my dock, I installed Dash to Dock and made my dock resemble the one in MacOS and Im pretty pleased with the results, I feel like Im slowly making Pop!\_OS my own.

I havent yet set up a virtual machine because Im pretty unfamiliar with that, but Im in no hurry atm. I did install Steam and Lutris from the Pop Shop but I havent tested any of my games so far, so that may be the part three thread maybe. Ive also only been using it for a day so far so not enough time to really have a full impression of things, Im also trying to look for some guides on what I should do on my new install just to make sure Im not doing anything wrong.

But yeah overall its been really good, Im really glad I made the jump and even though Im very new to everything the ease for which I can reach out and get help and advice makes me feel really confident about my decision. If anyone else was in the same boat as me I recommend they give it a try for sure because even though I did a dual boot I dont particularly feel like I miss anything from Windows atm.","Looks like your doing well! Gaming honestly will be where the majority of your hang ups will be bit thats depending on what you want to play. Advancements in gaming on linux are moving quite well though. Imo, its worth the trade off to be away from windows."
"I've been using linux since last year and still don't fell like ""advanced user"". Could use some guide what should I learn.","Hi there, I installed Lubuntu on my laptop last year. I chose this distro, cause my laptop is 10 years old, Windows 7-10 was not working great on it and Lubuntu is lightweight. I've been using Linux on daily basis since then, but I feel like I never actually learned anything at all. I usually use it like I used Windows and found it quite easy to learn. I installed needed programs via apt, after I googled ""how to install stuff on linux"" and I use top command after googling ""where's bloody task manager on linux"", cause my old laptop sometimes chokes on tasks and I need to disable some stuff. Apt and top are literary THE ONLY two commands I use in terminal. The rest of my time is spent in IDE and playing retro games - just like I did on Windows.

Now, I've heard a lot of stories of Linux being such a deep OS with steep learning curve, but with so many possibilities and I'd like to learn more about it, but in my personal experience all I really need is pretty straightforward. I was wondering if there is any advanced stuff I could learn, without changing distro. Would be glad for some tour among Linux advanced stuff.",[https://linuxjourney.com/](https://linuxjourney.com/)
Advice For New Linux Users: Read The Manual.,"For the last week I've been stuck on setting up some things on my Linux distro. Everytime I hit a wall I googled for answers in forums and reddit. Sometimes I get what I'm looking for, other times I fix my problem with some ducktape and rubber bands and hope I don't see it again. Now today I needed to install a library but the package manager was giving me problems so I tried doing it manually. Took me an hour or two until I decided to read the README file. I got my answer and it wasn't even that complicated. What I'm trying to say is, don't get the habbit to only use the forums and ask others to fix your problems without searching for it first. Read the wiki, man pages, README files or whatever that has a direct link to what you're dealing with. Cause most times the author has an answer for it or some poor sap got hit by it before you did. Learn from their headaches.

It's the equivalent to what Arch users keep saying. Read the wiki.","I feel like new users have to get used to looking for information in the man pages and README files before going online for help. But it's certainly not easy to do. Heck, I still do it. Sometimes it works out, but if I don't end up finding something immediately I just have a look to see if I can understand what is already there or that it has the information I need. But for a new user, the given documentation can be daunting or even like it's written in another language. Some other communities may encourage the opposite behaviour and I'm sure people come into the Linux community thinking it's the same. Existing users have to remember to be kind to those who are new, instead of making them feel like they're even dumber than they already think they are. Everyone should be welcome here, no matter what their previous level of knowledge is. :)"
Why does Mint get recommended THAT much ?,Its kind of the least appealing to me. Seams a bit bland idk. Cinnamon just looks meh but I guess its just rock solid and easy to learn ?

And cinnamon is similar to windows aesthetically."
Have been using linux for 1 month an thought I would add solutions to problems I faced. Please add your own so it would act as reference for newbies installing linux.,"# Linux solutions.

These are the solutions to linux issues I faced so far and their solutions.  
Documenting them here makes it easier for future setup  

## Sound not working.
open the alsa mixer through alsa mixer command.  
<F2> to select sound card.  
Unmute front speaker (and others) using M.  
Go to automute option and disable it by typing - .  
type sudo alsactl store  in terminal to save these settings for future. 

## Beep not working from terminal
This solution probably only works in Konsole terminal.  
Go to settings and edit current profile and choose ""system bell"" option in ""terminal bell"" mode.  

## Wine not showing up in right click menu
Usually after installing wine, it should be added to right click menu of an exe by default and should also run by doubleclicking it.  
Type this command in terminal to fix this:  

## Writing manjaro/arch iso to USB with unetbootin throws errors
Unetbootin is not reccommended.  
use the dd command.   
dd if=pathToISo of=targetUSBname (if is inputfile, of is outputfile)  
see the manjaro install guide for full details and reccommended extra arguments.  

## locale problems when using dmenu or i3 window manager.
Add this to your .bash_profile  
export LC_ALL=""C""  

## i3 window manager issues
add ""exec i3"" to .xinitrc   
change i3-sensible-terminal in the i3 config file to the terminal you actually have: konsole in my case.  

## vim being unable to copypaste to sysem clipboad
This is because most of the distros ship minimal vim with no clipboard support.  
check vim --version to see support for clipboard.   
Also ""set clipboard=unamedplus"" in vimrc to make default register copy paste to clipboard.",Use Ventoy instead of unetbootin. Ventoy works like a charm for every distro.
"If I start a program from the terminal, e.g. vlc, chromium, mpv and I close that terminal, why does it also close the program I started or rather why is the program running bound to that terminal? Why can't the application be opened as if I clicked it from the GUI.","I understand that it might be a sort of WYSIWYG approach? I mean if a user started a program from the terminal when they could have just clicked the icon... clearly there's some information they'd want to be seeing that they can maybe only view in the terminal?

By now I realize I've asked 3/4 questions, final one... whatever the case being... would an option to close the terminal soon as the program opens after which it was started from said terminal be possible or it breaks some philosophy?

EDIT: I didn't expect so many responses, thank you all. I've saved the post so I can come back to it later, read and try all the technical stuff.","It would be helpful to understand the relationship between parent and child processes.  When you open your browser in a terminal window the terminal session is the parent process and all child processes will exit when the terminal session ends.

What sets apart an advanced linux user from a beginner linux user ?,"I'm kinda new to Linux, and when I was searching for what distro to use I realized that many of the articles recommend ""Best Linux Distros for Beginner"", so this make me think what sets apart an experienced Linux user from a beginner?

How does one go from a beginner user to an experienced user?

ps. english is not my native language, sorry if there was any mistake","> Is there a certain point when you are considered an experienced user?

No, and further, these terms are very subjective, nearly useless. If I were you I would simply learn more about Linux and not concern yourself with such labels. If you encounter someone online who wants to label you a beginner in any but the most charitable and helpful way, beware the ubiquitous troll.

Unlike Linux practitioners, who appear in all varieties and skill levels, trolls are all the same -- they're to be avoided at all costs.

> How does one go from a beginner user to an experienced user?

Compare walking the dog versus flying to Mars. If you are very good at walking your dog, the Mars astronaut might ask you for lessons in dog-walking. Translated, this means (and quoting [Theodore Sturgeon](https://ritholtz.com/2013/07/90-of-everything-is-crap/)), these terms are 90% bulls**t."
How my first 48 hours of Linux went,"Currently working on some personal projects related to a headless Raspberry Pi and Linux. First one was to be a SFTP-server with a dir set on an external hard drive (for personal storage). Following is the log I made for future me to remember the things I did:

Seeking a distro for my Grandmother that we can setup and forget.,"My Grandmother is used to speedy iMac but recently moved to a trash Windows 10 all in one machine. Not sure exactly but I remember it has AMD graphics, Intel CPU and 4gb RAM. She finds it frustrating how slow it is and I'd like for her to be able to do her thing: check emails, browse web, print things, look at photos, manage documents swiftly and easily.

 I know Linux distros have incredibly low overhead and can manage hardware much better than windows 10 but I know for sure if something went wrong she would not be able to troubleshoot it very well or at all.

Is there a Linux distro that I can set and forget with a desktop environment with all the features mentioned that requires no maintenance. 

Thank you very much :D","[ElementaryOS](https://elementary.io/). Designed for usability, and looks like MacOS which she's used to."
"Why the hate on snaps, flatpacks and electron apps?","To me they look like useful and practical ways to get software, but it seems like a lot of people have problems with them. So, what’s the deal?","Snaps are similar to Flatpack but with major downsides:

- slow at first
- clog boot times
- automatic updates which you cannot disable
- no way to self-host snap repositories since the software is closed source
- doesn't respect system themes
- forced on the user with specific software (i.e. `chromium`) on Ubuntu 19.10 and 20.04

Combined downside of Flatpack/Snaps:

- there are two or three package managers instead of a single place where you update/install everything  
Though GUI package manager started to combine them

Electron:

- basically a mini chromium browser
- takes more ressources than ""native"" programs
- web browsers are the attack vector #1 on the internet, needs constant security updates
- seem slow if not done correctly or run on lower end hardware

Obviously there are also upsides like having an easier way to install newer software on long point release distros with Flatpack/Snap or having an easy way to make fancy cross-compatible GUI applications with Electron"
Why doesnt academia embrace Linux in open arms?,"Given that Linux is a collaborative open source software project and that universities are generally known for adhering to collaboration and open standards, it makes me wonder my many universities use Windows as the most common operating system for university computers. I think that Linux is such a missed opportunity for academia since getting more people to use Linux would ultimately help the Linux community in the long run.

So it makes me wonder, why doesn't academia embrace Linux in open arms and use it to power most computers on campus?","Because Apple, Microsoft etc make huge money deals with Universities and probably put a decent amount of resources into maintaining these contracts.

This is how to use Windows programs on Linux,"*Here's a quick guide:*

install **Bottles**, **WineHQ** *and* ***Steam*** *(Proton) (if you have games on it)*

# 🍷WineHQ

\-for installation programs, and all Windows programs that need to use or write to files on your machine.

# 🍶Bottles

\-To use Windows apps that don't need to write to your machine's files

\-For games that are executable (their setups must be run with WineHQ)

*(Unfortunately, double-clicking a Windows program from the files in Bottles is causing some problems as I write: open Bottle, create a Bottles “game” and “software”, then import programs from those bottles).*

# 💨Steam (Proton), only if you have games on it

To play your Steam games on Linux, go to :

*Settings > Steam > Compatibility > Steam Play (activate) > Proton experimental*

after which you'll be able to play any game in your Steam library.","also you can add any windows program to steam as ""add non-steam game"" and run it with different versions of proton."

"Seriously, arch elitism is not only rude for newcomers, it's absolutely unjustified (rant)","Ironically the main distros that are full of elitists/gatekeepers are the ones that have the better documentation (mainly arch), seriously, everyone can understand everything that they need in order to make those distros to work if they put enough time reading the wiki, it's pretty absurd to feel like a king amongst sheeple when your distro is the one of the best documented pieces of software on earth (not to say that feeling satisfaction for doing stuff on them is bad tho). If someone comes up with a doubt that they can't solve by themselves bc they lack the understanding in order to do so or they don't know where to look, please, at least give them a link relevant to their question instead of saying ""read the f\*ing manual"", and if you do it don't be condescending, that's how a software community should work, maybe they don't have the time to read the whole thing or don't know where to look yet but that's how people learn. Also, this is detrimental for any community that is developed around (mostly) free software, we should work together as much as we can.

When you dive into a hard distro you know it bc there is an atmosphere in the community of solidarity, f.e. nixos or gentoo users are extremely helpful towards newcommers, they are exponentially harder than arch and it shows. Stop tryharding, yeah, installing arch from scratch is pretty satisfactory and something to be proud of but arch was specifically designed to be a distro easy to build from scratch, saying that you use arch like if you discovered the Antartica only proves how little you know about linux in general and that you are still starting to learn linux, people who run/mantain nixos, gentoo, a linux server or a custom distro made with LFS (specially the last ones) are the ones who should be showing off but 9/10 times they don't. Stop being stupid and help people whenever you can, you are not a master hax0r for introducing a few commands in a tty, you are, at most, relatively competent. Be polite and nice to newcomers and stop being stupid.

Note: I know a lot of people that use arch aren't like this and I use/love artix myself but after spending some time in different linux communities this is something that really stands out and it's really annoying.

I know this isn't something that is going to end (at least soon) but I think that this rant is needed and shared by some people and I want newcommers to know that there are people out there who are happy to help them.

Also stop throwing shit at ubuntu users, ubuntu as a piece of software deserves it but not the users, stop being assholes.","On the flip, I slowed down a lot in trying to help people with computer problems because of shitheads.

You'll get something like this:
""My game won't run right, I tried everything, and Windows is running slow. Please help!!!""

So I would respond:
""What game? Are your drivers and windows up to date? What are your specs?""

Sometimes, it would be more along the lines of:
""Disable your windows auto drivers install, uninstall your GPU drivers, run ddu in safe mode and reinstall your drivers. What are your system specs? Did you try a game files validation?""

Because I dont know what they tried.

They then respond:
""I already fucking tried all that, I've spent hours on this. Do treat me like a fucking idiot.""


So they dont give you exact issues, dont tell you what they did, dont give you specs and treat you like an asshole.

I dont see anything wrong with the ""im trying to do X. Is there a way?"" type posts. They are usually met with elitism, and that annoys me. Because you dont know what you dont know. If you dont have the right terminology and names for things searching for a solution is a bitch. I'm just starting with Linux, so this is where I'm at. I know Windows and how to find solutions, Linux? I don't have all the vocabulary down to be self sufficent yet. On those, I'll tell the person what to search for. If I have the time and solution, I'll walk them through it.

debian votes to include non-free firmware in a single set of installers :),"The votes are in.

Help us to help you,"Hello!

In the last weeks I have been trying to help as much people as possible within my limited knowledge and experience in Linux but… I found myself repeating quite often the same things over and over again.

Most of the users post the same question in 2-3 different subreddits at the same time. I understand that is for getting a quicker answer but at the same time if makes more difficult for the ones that we are active in all these subs to give answers and the replies are spread around. Lately what I’m doing is copying pasting the same reply in all their questions but I don’t think is the best way either.

Other users do not explain anything at all… is the kind of post that says something like: help! Urgent! Or any other thing with exclamation marks plus something that is not very relevant to be able to fix it. I think in the rules it should be mandatory to provide hardware information, log information, what was the user trying to do,… because those are the main questions we need to ask over and over again.

With the rise of internet now the difference on your computer resources usage (for most of the users) will be achieved by the number of tabs open on the browser. Is true that Linux can use less resources than windows on idle but as soon as you start opening tabs on your browser the difference is not as substantial. 
With that said. Having 4gb of ram in 2022, unless you go for a “server” mode without X or with very limited use of it, will give you the same problems in all the operating systems, windows, Mac or Linux and you’ll need to do sacrifices in all them. Linux is good but cannot make miracles. That also mean that most of the Linux distros are mostly very similar… it changes the look and feel, the package manager, the number of packages available or installed and sometimes the init system. Asking for which distro is good for you bring the same answers over and over again… and there is even a subreddit for it!!

Linux has a pretty good support for old hardware but old does not mean ancient… I’m reading many posts with really old hardware that I understand that someone told to OP that Linux will make a miracle on it… maybe… but again sacrifices need to be done and if nvidia (for example) does not support your ancient graphic card… how can the Linux developers?

Appreciate your time (and other’s time!)! If the effort to fix something is 10 hours and you spend this 10 hours learning something that can make you more competitive to find a job… think that this job might be able to pay you for 10 hours of work enough to renew your ancient hardware… (10 for saying a number!). I understand personal challenges and that we all can be stubborn but… you’re not only using your time but the time of many volunteers that are here helping.

This is not a ranting post (or at least is not my intention!). I want to help but I want also to improve the outcome of our help. 

Help us to help you. Provide us with information. Tell us what you were doing, how, when and on what. Give us hardware info, distro name and version… that will help enormously!! And finally… consider if what you’re trying to achieve is worth your time and other’s time.

Thanks for reading.

Finally, take into consideration that we are probably from different countries and the way we talk can be taken (sometimes wrongly) as an offense (not my intention!).",">Help us to help you.

Not a chance.

What is meaning of Everthing is a file in Linux?,"I was studying about linux file system and the very first I stumbled across is that everything on linux is a file. I searched on google about this but found things somewhat complex for me to understand. I have done C and Python programming so I am guessing that Everything is a file means that some ""non-file"" things like processes which execute are like stream(like stdinput or stdoutput stream or like file buffer used to handle files). These things like streams, buffers etc. confuse me everytime I come across them so please explain in easy way if possible. And also can you suggest me a resources from where I can read about topics likes streams, buffers,files and filesystems.","Most system resources, including devices and settings are available as files."
Why exactly is Linux better for coding?,"Hey folks!
So I’ve been using Linux (Pop!_OS) for a while on my laptop while my main Desktop is still running windows (which I wanna get away from, eventually). I’ve heard people praising Linux for how well it works for coding and while I’ve coded fairly little on Linux, I do run into a few problems on Windows occasionally. Now to my question, are most coding related problems windows exclusive and Linux handles everything out of the box? Or why exactly do people keep saying that Linux just works better when it comes to coding?","I mean, while it is very dependent on which stack you're trying to use, pretty much all of your dev tools are written to be used in UNIX, this makes Linux and MacOS a lot more integrated with whatever you're trying to get done.

Think of the tools you might want to use for your development, they're all written for  UNIX-like systems: git, curl, vim, bash, all of your package managers.

A lot of tools you might need for specific tasks you might have to build from source, which from what I remember is a complete pain to do in windows.

Not to mention, if you're doing C or C++ all of your libraries are in sane places and easy to install using a package manager.

&#x200B;

There's many reasons that make UNIX systems better for development, but with WSL and modern tooling you can do it just fine on windows too."
Can anyone explain how ChromeOS can run Android apps flawlessly. But Linux doesn't support Android apps?,I have tried Anbox. But it's not mature as ChromeOS implementation. It looks like Anbox has long way to go to integrate apps with Linux system. Many apps which requires video or photo steaming struggles to run.,"Many android apps use propietary Google libraries, which would have to be reverse engineered."
Daily workflow since switching to Linux,"1. Boot up computer to get to work and start the day!
2. Click on podcast to listen to.
3. Audio won't play
4. Troubleshoot audio, open PC, check connections
5. Grub fails to boot now
6. Tear office apart looking for USB
7. Try to recover boot, run fdisk, realize drive is unplugged
8. Boot again, still not booting
9. Fix order in BIOS that automatically changed when unplugged
10. Now it boots, get to fixing audio again
11. Reinstall audio config, and it works.
12. Two hours later, finally, can start work, except TODO list is in Emacs orgmode, so just need to learn more elisp...

Linux is amazing, and the complete customization of everything is certainly what is keeping me here, but my ""actual work"" productivity is pretty much zero in the ramp up. Make the switch, just make sure you have time!","Eh?Daily Workflow:

1. log in (Boot, every morning? I only reboot when I have to)
2. start up some music or whatever
3. attend meetings, do work
4. leave work at end of day and go enjoy life.

\*Ubuntu as a daily driver for about 12 years now, Red Hat and CentOS before that, and haven't owned anything with Windows on it since the late 90's.  
The only times I've ever had days like yours were self-inflicted (well, there was one instance of a HDD failure).  Though early on in the mid-90s when I was first enjoying the wonders of Slackware (and early Red Hat in the 4.x days) I very often hosed my installations to the point of needing to reinstall from scratch.  But you learn valuable lessons :D"
How does Linux and Gnu developers make money?,"Hi,

Windows 10 vs Linux for University,"Hello everyone , 

First of all sorry for mentioning Windows here since it's a Linux community and I do not know if that's forbidden. Basically I am looking to buy a new laptop since I will be going to university now. I have been a Windows user since I was 8. I have Windows 10 on my dekstop PC but there is a lot of bloatware , things you cannot remove and an issue with privacy. Windows 11 will need specific system requirements which was a retarded move from MC. That's why I am thinking to slowly migrate towards Linux. But I do not know if it's a good idea and how hard the migration is. Personally from what I heard Linux is good for Uni students and you can use LibreOffice or VM for Microsoft Office. Should I do the migration? If you are or was a uni/college student did you have trouble with Linux?

I will be studying Physics so no need for CAD Software and Microsoft's Visual Code.","Use the software that the majority of your classmates and teachers use and that they and you are most familiar with, so you don't have to go through extra steps in each and every task, which will take away your focus and will undoubtedly hinder your study."
In what ways linux sucks?,"Okay so I wanna help my family switch to linux, but I'm pro linux so my opinion will be biased. I want your opinion on why linux is good and what are it's short-commings?

Also i'll be posting this in many prolinux and antilinux subreddits to get some diversity of opinions coz my opinion will be heavily biased","Software support, hardware support - you are not guaranteed that everything will work."
Could someone explain Desktop Environment versus Window Manager versus Compositor?,"Linux intermediate here. I know the DE thing very well (like GNOME, Unity, XFCE, LXQT etc.) but do not understand how that functions in an association with WMs or Compositors. Also the posts in r/unixporn baffle me how changing the WMs can make the DE look entirely different.

All I know right now is:

WM takes care of the app/applet windows arranging the three buttons for the user and shows the application title

&

Compositor has something to do with animation and effects of the windows while they appear/disappear etc.","A window manager handles the placement, movement and geometry of windows. It also handles titlebars, borders and other decorations. 

A compositor is responsible for transparency of windows and other fancy effects like fade in/out, preventing screen tearing, animations, etc.

A desktop environment is a set of tools, integrated together to give you a comfortable experience. It consists of window manager, compositor, statusbar, settings manager, polkit agent , etc."
Today i worked on a live production server!,"i've been working as a technical account manager in my company for about a year an a half now ( PC technician > Tech call center > Helpdesk before this job)





I was asking my CTO for more responsibility and more technical stuff to mess around with, he said alright after a while and threw me to the deep water of installing Gentoo + LFS and later all kinds of tasks related to the company I work in on staging environments, this all took a month and a half for me as i knew absolutely nothing ( i now feel know nothing+)
 




So today I had to diagnose why we were getting alerts on one of our client's servers running out of disk space . 

turn out his IP ACL was off for the VOIP system we run on the linux server so fail2ban logs were getting pretty big  along with the VOIP system logs.

to find this out i needed to do some digging around  using fd and ncdu to see exactly what was taking all the space

then I remembered there is a thing called logrotate , i needed to understand how it works and where the config files are located etc 
and after 2 hours of digging and learning  ..i cleared 7% of the hdd , guess i need to keep digging !


anyway , im probably explaining it bad probably but it was very cool and im glad to be taking my first live steps in the linux world",Congratulations. You went from knowing nothing to knowing that you know nothing :D
[META] Can we sticky a post about Kali?,"I’ve been seeing more and more posts about people trying Kali and fucking something up.

I get it. Kali is the leet hacker distro of choice, and who doesn’t want to hack the planet?

Is it normal to feel like a  moron when using linux,"I'm running Arch Linux btw and I am slighly astonished by how compromised my control of my system is, despite that being the whole selling point. I want a clean looking status bar like windows? I have to install a widget (waybar), edit JSON files (a format I have no experience in), do CSS wizardry, and repeatedly test for what I want. This took multiple days and honestly I was frustrated by how long it took. Peeps on youtube all make it seem like it's not a big deal, but it REALLY isn't. I keep thinking that it's just a learning curve, and that it'll get better over time, but I still find myself searching stuff up to do the most basic tasks. Is it normal to feel like a dumbass when using arch??","You went for, what's arguably the hardest linux distribution out there,i do not understand who recommended you to use arch as your starting distribution

So yes it is normal to feel like a moron, i started with Ubuntu (back in 16.04) which is a relatively noob-friendly distro, and myself felt like the biggest idiot in town, don't worry, you will overcome that feeling

You should rather use a simpler distro like Mint or even Fedora nowadays is rather easy to use"
Why Linux over Windows?,"Last week, I tried Linux (Pop!\_OS) for the first time. I enjoyed experimenting and learning how things work in Linux, but I found myself missing the ease-of-use of Windows. I understand the common reasons people choose Linux over Windows, such as better security, performance, and control. However, I’m looking for practical, real-world use cases where Linux is truly superior to Windows.

I use my computer daily for university work, general browsing, YouTube, gaming, and programming. Are there specific scenarios in these areas where Linux is objectively better than Windows? For example, when it comes to programming, are there tools or workflows in Linux that provide significant advantages?

I’m not necessarily looking for answers like “Linux is more secure” or “It runs smoothly on older hardware.” Instead, I want concrete examples where Linux genuinely shines in day-to-day use, gaming, or programming. While I understand there are very specific cases where Linux excels, I’m more interested in broader scenarios that might justify making Linux my primary operating system, rather than something I use only occasionally.

TL;DR: What are the practical reasons to choose Linux over Windows for everyday tasks, gaming, and programming?","If you don't see a difference then stay with windows. But I personally find Linux faster and easier to use.


Linux also gets in my way less, I had to boot up a windows vm for some work and it tried to sell me at least 2 things before I saw the desktop. To me that is in acceptable for MY computer.


It is also heavy on resources (ram, storage, etc) but with most people computes this will not matter much."
List of essential software I use for basic productivity.,"I just switched to Linux after using WSL for a long time. I thought I would have issues with sound drivers etc but everything is working well.  
Also linux resurrected my 10 year old laptop with  2GB ram which was unusable with windows 7.

Is there a reliable way to use Office 365 in Linux?,"Hi,

I have Linux (Fedora) and Windows 10 installed in dual-boot. I really want to ditch Windows and make the switch to Linux. The only thing that is preventing me from doing so is Microsoft Office 365. I need it for school so I can't use any alternatives. Is there any reliable way to install it on Linux? I need to have a fully-working Office 365 (no crashes, be able to use OneDrive and be able to collaborate in real-time with other students).

Thanks.","To  install it? No, there really isn't.

To USE it? Yes, install Microsoft Edge browser and access the ""enhanced"" online versions of Office 365 apps. They are not as good as the full versions, but are acceptable for most things.

Probably the best alternative to dealing with MS Office documents as accurately  as possible in Linux is with [OnlyOffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/)

If you must have a fully functional copy of Office 365 and the browser based versions won't cut it, you will need Windows. Sorry, but that is just the way it it."
Looking for less well known Linux Associations and Open Source Projects to donate to,"Hi,

A short description of the   good work they do & why they don't get as much attention as the   bigger distros...and associations would be immensely helpful as I need   to write a short description for each & the whole quiz is turning   out to be more time consuming than expected.

Also   if you have any ideas for quiz questions, that would really help me  out  as it is tricky to have a level playing field for all Linux levels   while keeping questions fun & interesting so if you have any   Linux/Open Source anecdotes or know any lesser known facts, then please   let me know here:

What makes Linux so secure?,"I was told I should put Linux on an end of life Chromebook so I can safely continue to use it.  

What makes Linux so secure?","I'm surprised that no one has yet mentioned the obvious reason: Linux software is 99% of the time installed directly from official repositories, which are actively maintained by the open source community. You never randomly download binaries from the internet and run them with root hoping that you'll be safe, unless you're utterly insane. Windows is now trying to catch up with the store thing, but their ecosystem is still chaotic and vulnerable."
"If you could pick ONE thing about the Linux operating system to tell a rookie Linux user, before he/she starts using Linux, what would it be?","I think I would tell them, when downloading or transferring or uploading a file, be patient! I'm used to Windows or Mac and when moving a file I would always get the sweet little ""progress"" bar that pops up. It would show how far along the download or transfer was. Slowly moving up from 1%,2%,3%.....99%,100% complete! I'm not saying Linux repos don't have that, what I'm saying is the operation isn't really as... correctly represented as I'm used to maybe? There has been many times when I would watch the progress bar or even if I -v and watched it in the command line, and it would stop at a certain percentage for a very long time. In fact, long enough so that I would become nervous the download or transfer froze or became corrupted. I would cancel it on my own and try again. After a while I have come to learn that I was wrong, the process was still working in the background, it just wasn't showing me correctly on the GUI or command line. So my advice, be patient, let Linux do its thing! It's a very reliable platform, have faith in the Linux machine!!","Don't listen to Ubuntu/Mint hatred; don't jump into Arch because somebody thinks its cool.  These are 2 things that will lead to many newbies becoming frustrated with Linux and going back to Win/Mac.

Why does linux take up so much less room than MS Windows?,"A default Ubuntu install is 4GB in size, and even includes Libreoffice, and Firefox by default.  However, MS Windows 10 + Office 2016 takes up over 25GB fully updated, but nothing else installed.  Why is this?","Because of the way the two systems are put together.

On Windows, for any typical application, all the needed dependencies are bundled in with the application.  
These dependencies are used only for that one application.  
There's very little sharing (save for the standard win32 GUI dependencies and networking)  
If a program needs to decode and manipulate PNG graphics, then libpng (or whatever the Windows equiv. is) is bundled with the application.  
You may find that you have the same library files installed multiple times for multiple applications.  
This also makes updates (esp. security updates) troublesome in the Windows world.
This is due to Windows not having any sort of competent package management system.

Contrast this with Linux (and other *nixes), where all the dependencies are shared among all the programs that need them."
Is linux suitable for a non-programmer???,"Hi everyone,

I was thinking of shifting to linux from windows. I have used ubunto in past, for a very short duration. I'm in academics, so I mainly use laptop for drafting manuscripts etc (mainly MS office), or for browsing and videos. I am also planning to start learning python and R.

Why is Manjaro not recommended more for noobs?,"After switching to POP OS and figuring out the software installation method for many programs is comprised mainly of adding ppa after ppa, I'm confused why ubuntu based distros like linux mint, POP OS, elementary, zorin, and Ubuntu itself are the go to recommendation for distros for beginners.

Beginner posts and guides often recommend veering away from the terminal to not intimidate beginners and let them get used to the OS but then they'll recommend ubuntu based distros for which using the terminal and adding ppas can be the only option for alot of essential programs, if its even available through ppa or instead having to install software through snaps, for which the community normally recommends against.

Compared to using something like Manjaro which  has the access to the AUR. I know its based on Arch but from what I understand Manjaro is similar in complication to ubuntu. But a one stop centralized area to download whatever software the user needs, including software that may only  be available on Ubuntu as a snap to me seems to make Manjaro the far more user friendly choice for almost any beginner.

I am a noob to linux myself, which is why I was wondering why beginner recommendations are skewed the way they are?","> Why is Manjaro not recommended more for noobs?

Because:

* Noobs need online help more than others.

* Online help is most plentiful for commonly used distributions.

* The most commonly use distributions are Ubuntu and Debian and their derivatives.

arch linux isn't hard to use??,"so like 2 months ago i was on tiny11 (chopped down version of windows 11) and i decided to switch to linux, specifically arch linux (for the funny), made a bootable usb with rufus, and installed the GNOME version. so far it's been super easy to use it, i just install everything with flatpak and i don't get why everyone is saying arch linux is hard to use. maybe it's cuz i selected the GNOME version?? can someone explain?",now do it without using the archinstall script.
Alternatives to OneNote for Linux,"Hey guys,

I've recently installed Ubuntu on my laptop and so far I'm quite happy with it.

I've also tried Simplenote, which is actually quite amazing with it's markdown and whatnot, but it's a bit too simple, in the sense that you can't organize notes and use media. I'm planning to use my laptop in college so I require a bit more than that.

How to reset your Linux Mint password: a guide,"I had to reset the password in a Linux Mint 19.2 VM recently. I tried following the guide on the Mint website, but it’s way too complicated for someone who’s never done it before. Fortunately, I accidentally discovered a much easier method:

1. Hold down the shift key while turning on your computer to show the boot menu (GRUB). You don’t need to do this if the GRUB menu already shows up by default.

2. Choose the option labeled “Advanced options for Linux Mint”

3. Go to the very second option, which should be labeled “Linux Mint [insert version here], with Linux [insert version here], (recovery mode)”

4. You will be taken to a “Recovery Menu”. At this menu, choose the entry labeled “root”. When it says “Press Enter for maintenance”, press the Enter key.

5. Now type: passwd (Your user name here)

6. Type in your new password (to first-timers: it’s ok that you can’t see anything while you’re typing!)

7. Type exit after you’re done setting your new password and pick resume normal boot from the menu.

Is Linux a Kernel or an Operating System?,"On many news platforms and books Linux is described as an OS but IIRC Linux was a Kernel developed by Linus. Is Linux a Kernel or an OS?

Edit: Thanks! Everyone tried to explain as much as they could. There were a few long write ups, which I read and came to know about controversy surrounding the name.","Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that  allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run.  The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by  itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating  system.

Is it possible to use only Linux for everyday and work?,"Hello guys. I'm a computer engineering student and I'm going to buy a new laptop in next months.

Actually I have a MacBook Pro I'm in love with.

My general ""work"" include the use of:

- VLC

- MS Office

- IDEs

- Mail client

- Spotify

- Telegram desktop

But I can't say what I'm going to use in the future.

My question is if it worth to use Linux in everyday life so I could by a non-Apple laptop to install it and use as my primary OS (simply because I don't want to use Windows).

Thanks in advance.","As others have written, what you are asking for is 100% do-able, though it depends on your particular situation and needs.

For example--Telegram, Spotify, VLC, and many email clients have Linux versions. There are tons and tons of IDEs to choose from, on Linux. The one catch for you could be MS Office: there is no official Microsoft version for Linux. There is LibreOffice (used to be OpenOffice), which has all (or at least most) of the same functionality. The UI is closer to MS Office 2007-ish,than it is to modern MS Office, so it may take a couple days to adjust where you expect to find things, but it's all basically there, and LibreOffice supports a lot of different file formats, including MS Office.

The problem comes when you try and open your LibreOffice document in MS Office. I find that when I write equations, or format tables in LibreOffice, when I open it in Word (even using the correct file format), the equations usually disappear and the formatting in tables can sometimes go funky. If MS Office is mission-critical (such as because you are often working on something with more than just you and they definitely will not switch), that could be a real problem. On the other hand, you coil try dual-booting, but I've never done it with a Mac, since I migrated from Windows.

You could learn LaTeX, as well, but that's like trying to solve a problem with a screw not going into a hole by getting a multitool. It's got a lot of gadgets and gizmos, but you really only need the one tool to work.

But yes, daily work on Linux *can be done* quite simply, but you may run into issues if you need to share work with others to modify if you can't use--say- Google Docs or something. (which I wouldn't recommend anyway, personally, but it'd be a workaround.)"
Could someone ELI5 regular expressions?,EDIT: Loads of good answers. Thank you everybody. Now everything it's clear. I think I'll just need to make some practice now. Thank you a lot. :D,"**What is a regular expression?**  It's a concise way to describe a finite state automata.

**What does that mean *in English*?**  It's a matching machine.  But instead of saying ""is it john"" (`variable == 'john'`) you're saying ""does it look like john, John, Jon, Johnn, jon"" (`variable matches [Jj]oh?n+`), you can use ""if""s to do this instead, but for a word like Johnny where you wanted to let just upper and lowercase on some letters, you can get to 10 or 20 'if' statements really fast.  (there are programs to automatically generate these if statements from regular expressions called ""parser generators"" or ""lexers"")

**Are they the same in every language?** No.  Syntax varies between languages and tools, especially ""metacharacters"" which are shortcuts that go backslash letter (example: `\b`) and different tools have different support.

**What's with the weird slashes? (in some languages)**  They're the same as quotes around strings in languages that use them. (`sed` lets you choose in the substitute command, slashes are generally *the worst* possible choice since you're usually replacing paths and that leads to a lot of escaping; most tutorials tell you to use slashes.  I recommend #)

**What can you usually count on?**

1. Literal letters.  If you put a j you want to know if it's a j
2. Classes. Generally anything in these brackets [abc] will match a or b or c.  
3. Just a dot usually means any letter. (what is a letter though may vary especially if you speak a multibyte language like Korean)
3. Options (x|y) x or y shines in ((James)|(John))
4. Quantifiers: how many: exactly 1 (nothing), one or more (+), or 0 or more (*), 0 or 1 (?)

So, if I want to match John OR Jon, I can say: 

\^[Jj]oh?n$

This means you want something that:

\^ means start of line  
[Jj] means starts with J or j,  
o means literally the letter o,  
h means literally the letter h, but ? means either 1 or 0 of them.  that is to say ""h is optional""  
n means literally the letter n  
$ means the end of the line

So, ^ and $ are new, and they prevent matching a line of ""Joneses"" because we maybe don't want that in our application.  Maybe we have a file with one name per line of people in the school and we wanted to know how many johns there were and we're going to pipe it into `wc -l` for that.

So, then you found out there's a few Johnns at the school and maybe one 'Johnnn'; someone even mentioned a 'Johnnnn'.  So, you want to match any string with however many 'n's on the end, but at least one, so now you do [Jj]oh?n+.  The + means 1 n, but also any more 'n's.

So, all there's some characters there that are part of regular expressions, what if I want to match ""+"" or ""?"" well, then  you have to escape them with backslash.  So, let's say you wanted to know if someone entered an addition problem?  You can say [1234567890], but there's a shorthand for that in most languages like `\d`, so, all you have to do is check if it matches `\d+\d` for one digit, but wait! that actually just means digits, so this is where they start looking stupid: `\d+\\+\d+'  which is:

\d means any digit and the + means 1 or more.   
\\+ means the literal ""+""  
\d again means any digit and the + means 1 or more."
Why do people recommend gaming distros?,"This sub likes to recommend gaming distros whenever someone mentions that they want to game on linux, but it personally seems like a bad suggestion as those distros are niche in comparison to the larger ones. The development teams are much smaller and they are relatively new, so it's a bit uncertain how will they will be supported in the near future. There's a lot less documentation overall so if the user runs into an issue,  its harder to solve their problem.

The only convincing argument is that they install the latest drivers for you, but in my opinion, if your hardware is so bleeding edge that you need a gaming distro, your eventually going to have to deal with managing your system on the command line anyway. 

Let me know if theres something im wrong about or missing!","By the time one of those distros is not supported any more, those people will have enough experience with Linux in order to make an informed decision about their next distro."
is ubuntu really that bad?,"i tested ubuntu and installed instantly flathub and i tried to not using snaps, and it was really solid and good. i don‘t know why so many hate ubuntu.","The issue isn't Ubuntu or snaps, its that Ubuntu is FORCING snaps. For example, if you do `sudo apt install steam` you would expect apt to install the deb build of steam from the Ubuntu repo. Well on Ubuntu, it instead sees you ran `sudo apt install steam` and instead runs `sudo snap install steam` and forces you to install the snap build, which is buggy, unofficial, and advised against by Valve themselves.

They were supposed to unify linuxes and save us all... and they were actually doing it until ubuntu 10.04 i believe. The heyday of ubuntu. They arent the most popular distro out of thin air. Most people switched to ubuntu at some point due to sane, quality releases, where everything worked out of the box in a sane way

At some point, the marketing team kicked in (I think it was just mark's own vision that blurred in front of him). Being the same as windows without the malware wasnt enough... They needed to differentiate themselves and reinvent the wheel, with their own spin. Changing everything just for the shake of being different. Throwing out the window years of shared knowledge in UI and common sense

when gnome 2 and gtk2 was replaced, Ubuntu was forced to redo their ui work on top of gnome 2. They should had made what cinnamon did. Take gtk3 and make a sane normal desktop. Or even better, switch to a sane library like qt altogether. I wish the unified-across-all-devices touchable-screen frenzy never happened

as sad as it is, today, ubuntu is still popular because they are still surfing the wave they created with quality releases back then

Dont take me wrong... They are still putting out quality releases. Basically because they ride on debian quality shoulders that put out 97% of what ubuntu ships

But they arent the saviour distro anymore. They cant take the windows refugees in bulk like they were able to do in the past...

Fedora vs Ubuntu. Feels like im missing something. Someone please make it make sense.,"So im window shopping to see if Linux would be a good alternative to migrate from windows since W11 is going down a path i can no longer ignore. Everyone i saw unanimously recommended Fedora as THE main distro to get now if you want stability and gaming and usability. 

  
However, as soon as i started, there it was. Wifi card not recognized, do this and that command, check this thingie is mounted correctly, etc etc. And im still like, its the year of the lord 2024 how is it fucking possible something as dumb as ""get my wifi card"" is not completely transparent? Then well, linux is growing on gaming, im SURE installing Nvidia drivers will be a walk in the park, right!? rpm fusion package this, secure boot that, dont use the nvidia one this, use these console commands that.... and it worked! But, again, 2024, incredible that i cant just double click a thing and get the drivers installed and move along on my day. I want an OS, not another hobby. Also, im dual booting from Windows, and the other 2 disks i have were nowhere to be seen, had to mount them and what not. Other than that everything seemed fine minus some hiccups here and there installing dev tools and building Unreal from source and lots of confusion about who the hell is Wayland and who hurt him and why X11 is his darkest nemesis. 

  
Then, thanks to a coworker, i decide to try Ubuntu, which i used before in the Unity days and stopped using exactly because of the Unity days. The installer live image had already recognized my wifi card... Install was done, update done and lo and behold, nvidia drivers installed. Download steam and would you look at that, Proton is already working. Flawless. Exactly what i want from an OS. The windows disc? already mounted and ready to open my files from there. Chef kiss. 17 minutes and i went from the setup tool to up and running pulling my stuff from github into Rider with Darkest Dungeon running in another workspace. 

  
So, please im obviously too new into Linux to know whats going on, but why on earth would anyone recommend Fedora instead of Ubuntu if THAT is the out of the box experience?

"What's the benefits of ""everything is represented as a file"" approach?","While I saw people highlight it as one of Linux benefits, I tried to found any information about this in Google, but found (almost) nothing.

So why exactly this approach is found better than relying on system-provided APIs, like in Windows, and is it *actually* better?","The ""files"" *are* the APIs -- except that you don't need any specific library to use them. All you need in a programming language is the ability to open a file, and that's almost certainly a given in nearly all of them.

That means that *you do not need any library to be able to access many of your system's subsystems*. Hardware temperature sensors? Process information? Battery status? Just `fopen()` the corresponding endpoint file and read the information, done.

In some cases you can even use this to directly access hardware registers. For example, you can expose the I2C bus(es) of your system as filesystem endpoints, or perhaps the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi, and read from/write to them using nothing but bash. (A very common use case for this is controlling your system's fans, for example.)

Another aspect is piping: You can pretty much pipe any file into any other file, which makes it easy to accomplish many tasks that would need a specialized tool or GUI e.g. on Windows. Want to create a backup image of a disk? `cat /dev/sdx > /tmp/backup.img`. Want to discard the output of some command? `command > /dev/null`. Want to leverage the system's random generator, e.g. to create a file filled with random data? `dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/random.bin bs=2k count=1`."
Why does everyone hates on GNOME ?,"I am running linux for almost a year now, I've never been an expert I just used it to do pretty normal things. One thing I did a lot is trying new distros and DEs. ( I distrohopped like an animal !!! ).

Looking at the forums I always noticed that practically everyone hates the GNOME desktop environment, they say it's ugly and bloated and heavy on RAM. 

I'm now using GNOME since 4 months because it looks different from Windows or MacOS (it is sad to see that practically every desktop environment tries to be as similar to Windows as possible). I never had problems or bugs in gnome the only annoying thing is packagekit but I just remove it and lock it. I also like it because you don't have any dock/panel taking out screen space, so I can run my programs practically full screen (only having the black top bar but that is actually very slim). I can switch workspaces with keyboard and that's cool :)

People say that GNOME is heavy but it actually runs on 800/900 MB at idle and, yes KDE runs on something like 700 MB but are 100/200 MB actually relevant on a modern system that usually has from 8 to 16 GB of RAM?

Thanks in advance for the attention ;)","Gnome was designed around the idea of mobile and desktop integration... one interface to rule them all.  The market has proven this to be a flawed approach... sacrificing desktop usability and performance for handheld support which no one uses.  Also GNOME3 has been dumbed down... if you design a user interface for everyone it does not work well for anyone... especially for technical and pro users.  GNOME seems to always be doubling down on these two unhelpful directions.

Because of this GNOME2 was wonderful and featureful, then it was dumped for GNOME3 by the developers... and it fragmented the community and users.  Now when you say GNOME what to you even mean?  MATE (a GNOME2 fork), GNOME (GNOME3), Unity (which is now dead), or Cinnamon (an attempt to make GNOME3 look like GNOME2). It also lead to a lot of software incompatibilities too which we are stuck with... i.e. between GNOME2 and 3, and all of the following systems MATE, GNOME, Cinnamon, XFCE, etc.  It is a real mess now.

There is also the question of how much graphics acceleration that one needs.  If your using GNOME on laptop fine, but if you want to run it remotely via VNC or with a VM when you don't have hardware acceleration, software rendering is very slow and unappealing.  Use to be there were a lot of options in GNOME2 and the window manager that allowed it to work without acceleration... but now... these have all been removed and your forced to use XFCE for example for these shorts of use cases or put up with a very slow GNOME3.

There is also the application developer side... where GTK2 was somewhat cross platform... GTK3... I don't thing anyone would recommend that for cross platform support.  As a result we are kind of stuck with QT for that... and that is not native in terms of GNOME.  Again a real mess.

So there is no one answer.  Do I use GNOME, yes... but only in cases where I have hardware acceleration like on my laptop for example.  Elsewhere I use XFCE.  And yes it is a real mess."

ive heard of something called building linux from scratch is this a good method to learn linux from the bottom up?


sorry for being so noob. Ive been a windows user since i was 4 years old and im in my late twenties now trying to learn something that seems foreign.","You might try a simple Linux Wargame like Bandit:

How do you use Linux without breaking it?,"Now, this is probably just a me problem, but I'm really struggling to retain a functioning installation for more than 2 months. I'm serious, and I don't know what to do!

Basically, you know how Linux often acts up? It's like, minor bugs or hiccups are to be expected, particularly when you're messing around? Well, that often happens to me, and I have no idea what to do in that case, so, out of desperation, I'll do dumb stuff like `sudo apt install kde*` to fix some graphical error with the KDE desktop environment. As a result, I often end up reinstalling the OS, leading to major wastes of time.

I can't be the only one, right? Is there something I'm missing or something? I feel like I'm meant to look after a house while not knowing how to walk or something!

Thanks in advance, I guess. I feel like a trainwreck.","Well, you're the one who mentioned dumb stuff so I'm gonna suggest you quit doing it  :D

1.  Understand what you're doing before you do it.  The moment you can't explain why you're performing a particular step is the moment you're in over your head and need to back up and figure it out.

2.  If it doesn't work trying it again as root is generally a terrible idea.

3. Don't go somewhere you can't get back from.  Almost every Linux text editor can make a backup of any file you edit.  If you can put it back the way it was before you started messing with it you can do pretty much anything you want  :)  Also, backups.

4.  Random blogs and youtube videos are of questionable value.  Get your technical support from a trusted resource - your first stop should probably be your distribution's documentation.

Short version?  Understand it before you do it.  When you edit a config make a backup first.  Get your support from trusted resources.

Good luck -"
Why do so many companies contribute to Linux kernel?,"Like Facebook and Microsoft, what exactly do they contribute to the Linux kernel? 

Also, doesn't this make Linux super bulky over time if everyone is adding things constantly? What if you don't want any new features?","They contribute because they use it, so it's better for everyone and therefore themselves when other companies do it."
"I know jack shit about Linux, but I want to switch form windows 10 to Mint, which I heard was user friendly and better for gaming","The thing is, I understand that drivers don’t work the same way on Linux.

I am edging to switch to Linux. Windows 10 is getting worse as a user and i am fed up.,"I've built my PC back in 2021, and since upgraded both CPU and GPU. It is AMD based.

\-Ryzen 5700x

\-MSI Radeon 6600xt.

I've been using windows since the day of light. However as corps get greedy and salesmen fill up the room more than programmers, I've been shying to switch to Linux.

I have done a lot of research on linux and i have a general base understanding of it's purpose, and i also know that SteamOS is the blueprint for games to be expanded upon Linux, and it has me hooked, discovering that Linux is more optimized for AMD than it is for Windows.

I Mainly want to switch to Linux for Gaming, Possible content creation, and possible program language learning. I've been leaning into switching into Arch, to take full control of my system and to take control of my hardware usage.

Any experts on this matter, i would like some advice on things i should know before fully switching, specifically gaming compatibility, content creation programs running on Linux, and things i should consider while learning Linux. Last question, i want to trial run this, should I do it using my external HHD drive? it barely uses any games, but has most of my media files (Music, Pictures and gaming videos), i guess in other words, Dual Boot before fully commiting to linux? Or should i use a VM to test the waters to get a basic feel of the System?

  
EDIT AFTER REPLIES AND ADIVCE: I want to thank you all for the advice and recommendations onto my next step for my Linux Journey. 

Main Takeaways:

\-I should avoid Arch Linux for the time being

To confirm this, i loaded up EndeavourOS on a VM, and the first thing I tried doing was installing Sudo, couldn't get it to work after 30 minutes, later deleted the VM.

\-I should use Linux Mint

   While I hear strong praise for this distro for gaming, i heard that Mint is not the most updated Distro for AMD since it is relied on Ubuntu or something like that. However it might be my top 3 distros i might choose

\-Anti-cheat systems games are borked.

   Fortunely, I dropped these kind of games a year ago, Valorant, COD, and Siege. 

\-Bazzite (OS that is mainly based around Gaming), CachyOS (Arch-Based, and praised for its shockingly gaming performance and its ease-of-use with minor tinkers.) 

After all considerations, i have bought a flash USB, i will try out CachyOS and use it on my recent NVME drive (it barely has 5 steam games, thats all the files).

Moving to Linux as a daily OS,"Hello, everyone. So, a bit of background. I'm what people would call a Microsoft fanboy. I've been a dotnet developer for 18 years. I've used windows since version 3 and MS-DOS since version 3.2.

However, since MS has released dot net core, this opened up the possibility of running it on Linux, which is obviously a cheaper option.

Now, in terms of using Linux as a server OS, I'm fairly comfortable. It's the daily usage that I haven't touched in about 10 years or so since I've last tried it.

Back then there were all sorts of driver troubles, kernel recompiling (if you were even able to find the driver) and so forth, which has put me off.

Which brings us to today. I'm planning on changing my laptop in the intermediate future and, while I'm a big fan of Windows, by the time I will need a new laptop the only Windows version available will be 11. That's a no-go for me, as it has become a comodified advertising platform.

Now, in terms of software availability, I'm not particularly concerned. I've got VS Code for Linux and, besides that, Firefox runs just fine. But I also worry about the driver availability, since the laptop will be a new one and I'd like to know what the state of driver support is like nowadays, what the video performance is like for the occasional youtube video and how usable the desktop environments are. The last ones I've used were Gnome and KDE but I see there are way more options nowadays.

Is there any particular distribution you'd recommend? Or desktop manager? 

Thanks.","The best way to avoid driver issues is to buy a laptop that was built for Linux. Vendors then ensure that it is great kernel-level support for the hardware. Buying hardware built for Windows and then throwing Linux on it is always a hit or miss.

You can buy them from major hardware vendors like Lenovo and Dell. Examples include Lenovo X1 Carbon, Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition, and HP Dev One. Dedicated Linux only vendors like Purism, Tuxedo, and StarLabs are worth checking out as well."
Microsoft 365 is keeping me chained to windows,"TLDR: I have access to microsoft 365 for free through my family which gives me access to 1tb of cloudstorage in oneDrive. Is there a way to get oneDrive working on linux the way it does in windows, or would I need to bite the bullet and change to a service with native linux support?

Hi! Both my parents do a lot of writing in their work so recently they got a microsoft 365 family subscription, and since it's only the two of them and the service allows for up to 6 users, they let me use it as well at no cost to me. Since then I have deeply integrated it into my life and work flow. Being able to use microsoft office is nice but I've used a variety of open source office suites in the past so that is not the main issue. It is the 1tb (!) of cloud storage that I get for free.

For the longest time I've used the free dropbox plan to store my documents in the cloud so I could access them anywhere, but now I can store almost anything with the 1tb in OneDrive. Documents, music collection, photos, everything is there and synced to my desktop, laptop and phone.

At the same time, my frustrations with windows have been increasing over the years but I've stuck with it because there has always been something that I could not get working on linux. Now with win11 on the horizon I once more feel compelled to se if I can ditch windows in favour of linux. A lot has happened over the years to make linux more appealing and approachable to normies and noobs like myself, so the main thing that is keeping me on windows this time is the lack of oneDrive functionality.

My question is this: is there a way to get oneDrive working in linux the way it does in windows, a folder that appears in the file manager, that syncs my files to the cloud? I've found out about Insync which seems promising but I find very little info on how it actually works and how it is to use. I could also go back to dropbox however I'd rather avoid paying for yet an other subscription if I can.

Edit: thank you so much everyone for all of your suggestions! I felt quite lost this morning but now I have a much better understanding of what my options are! You've given me many solutions to explore and a lot to think about.","I use rclone with encryption for OneDrive, works great, though I use it for backups only."
Windows vs. Linux in Geekbench: Results.,"Hi folks,

As a dual-booter (Linux Manjaro and Windows 10), I was curious to see how each compared in terms of speed and efficiency.

In both operating systems, all background tasks were killed to best of my ability.  Here are the results.

Test | Windows | Linux | Difference
---------|----------|----------|----------
Single | 1225 | **1291** | +5.3% (Linux)
Multi | 7297 | **7772** |  +6.6% (Linux)

Linux is ~6% faster on the same hardware at the same clocks.

[Screenshots of results here](https://imgur.com/a/YkPuDfm).

**Is this the result of Linux's better CPU scheduling?**

--------------------

Edit: computer specs and testing parameters:

- Geekbench 5.3.1 on both operating systems.
- Windows 10 20H2, fully updated.
- Manjaro 5.9.11-3, fully updated.
- AMD Ryzen 5 3600 locked at 4.075 GHz done to eliminate inconsistent boosting.
- 32 GB DDR4 @ 3400 MT/s.
- RTX 2070 Super (likely irrelevant).
- Each OS installed on a separate NVMe drive (likely irrelevant).

For Windows 10, Windows Debloater was used to remove unnecessary bloatware (Cortana too), and all unnecessary background services were set to disabled. Antivirus and indexing were disabled (through Group Policies). No monitoring or control software was running the background.  It was a clean install, less than a week old.

For Manjaro, no monitoring software was run, and all unnecessary background tasks were killed.  It was a clean install, less than a few days old.","What's happening is that Windows doesn't use write caches for removable media (so that when users see the progress bar reach the end, they can remove the drive without data loss).

Linux uses write caches for everything (by default), so what you're seeing is the speed of writing to the cache. The actual speed (of writing from the cache to the drive, which happens in the background) should be similar to Windows.

> Although... sometimes it gets incredibly slow with some files, not sure why.

That happens when the cache fills up when you're still copying files. The program copying the data has to wait for the data in the cache to be written so it can copy more data to the cache, so the speeds drop to the actual write speed of the drive."
Should I switch to Linux expecting faster performance than Windows 10?,"I have a Dell Inspiron, 2012 edition, with just 2GB of RAM and Intel Core i3. I have been thinking to switch to Linux for better performance. I shortlisted a few after looking at a few YT videos on Linux Distros: Zorin OS Lite, Manjaro, and Linux Mint, which one can work the best for me in terms of performance?  
My usage is mainly of casual browsing (YT), movies (VLC), and MSOffice work.","Upgrade to SSD will get you noticeable performance on any platform, also a bit of bump in RAM. You will not get MS Office but LibreOffice is available. Go for any Ubuntu flavour distro, first."
How To Set Up Ubuntu 20.04 for Gaming With No Terminal Commands,"Hi everyone.

I've produced a quick video that covers setting up an installation of Ubuntu 20.04 for gaming by installing and configuring Steam Proton, Lutris, Wine, Feral Gamemode, nVidia GPU drivers and Liquorix Kernel all without using any Terminal commands.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3whS0GfB1nU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3whS0GfB1nU)

This was produced based on previous feedback on my videos that using the Terminal would be off putting to potential new users of Linux.

For people who prefer a written guide, see below:

**STEP 1 - ADD PPAS FOR NVIDIA GPU DRIVERS, LUTRIS, AND LIQUORIX KERNEL**

Open the Software & Updates utility and navigate to the Other Software tab, and click the Add button. In the APT line you want to type in the following:

For Lutris: deb [http://ppa.launchpad.net/lutris-team/lutris/ubuntu](http://ppa.launchpad.net/lutris-team/lutris/ubuntu) focal main

For nVidia GPU Drivers: deb [http://ppa.launchpad.net/graphics-drivers/ppa/ubuntu](http://ppa.launchpad.net/graphics-drivers/ppa/ubuntu) focal main

For Liquorix Kernel: deb [http://ppa.launchpad.net/damentz/liquorix/ubuntu](http://ppa.launchpad.net/damentz/liquorix/ubuntu) focal main

Then click the Close and Reload buttons to refresh the repositories.

**STEP 2: USE SYNAPTIC PACKAGE MANAGER TO INSTALL NVIDIA GRU DRIVERS, WINE, LUTRIS, STEAM, AND LIQUORIX KERNEL.**

For nVidia GPU Drivers, search for nvidia-driver and mark the latest version for installation.

For Wine, search for wine stable, and mark wine for installation.

For Lutris, search for lutris, and mark lutris for installation.

For Steam, search for steam, and mark steam-installer for installation.

For Liquorix Kernel, search for linux-image-liquorix-amd64, and mark for installation.

Once done, click the Apply button, and once installation is complete, reboot the system.

**STEP 3: ENABLE STEAM PROTON FOR ALL GAMES IN A STEAM LIBRARY**

Launch Steam, sign into your account, navigate to Steam / Settings / Steam Play / Advanced and tick the Enable Steam Play for all other titles option, and restart Steam to apply.

**STEP 4: ENABLE FERAL GAMEMODE TO WORK WITH GAMES LAUNCHED THROUGH STEAM OR LUTRIS**

Feral Gamemode is pre-installed in Ubuntu 20.04.

For Steam: Launch Steam, click on the properties of a game, navigate to SET LAUNCH OPTIONS and type the following:

gamemoderun %command%

For Lutris: Launch Lutris, navigate to Preferences, System options, and type the following into the Command prefix:

gamemoderun

Please note that you will need to tick the Show advanced options for the Command prefix to appear.

Either way, click Save once done.

Ryan",But...what's the fun in linux if you don't use the terminal?  (sarcasm)
TIFU by creating an command that kills window on click,"I have an app that occasionally crashes on my system. To restart it I use - xprop to find PID, kill -9 to terminate. I thought it would be cool if I could terminate the app on xprop click. So i wrote a script to do that: ```kill $(xprop |grep -e ""_NET_WM_PID(CARDINAL)""|awk '{print $3}')```

It worked very well and I was happy about it! I went to my .bashrc to create an alias for it. I thought xkill would be a fitting name. Just before I assigned the alias I thought Ill check if the alias was not taken by anything else... And it was... xkill does function in exact same way my script does

TL;DR created a script that already exist","Well, at least you can be confident in your ability to name things!"
Made the plunge and it was easy! You can do it!,"In case there are people here on the fence about switching, I just want to give you a nudge. I have only rudimentary computer skills. Started reading about Linux 3 days ago, as I’m trying to learn some basic computer science (determined to be able to help my toddler daughter have skills for the future). That led to me wanting a Linux computer I can play with. So today I took my ancient and unusable (unfixable  grey screen) 2010 MacBook Air and switched it to Xubuntu. It worked nearly flawlessly and now I have a surprisingly fast little netbook! 

Only issue was on my first attempt I had a bad version of the install image file so got a weird error. Googled the error, redownloaded to file and bang, worked.

Want to say thanks to everyone who contributes to this kind of software and to support communities! Gives me hope for the future of computing.

Edit: Typo.","I took the plunge 15 years ago. Never regretted it, to this day. Linux was like it was made for me. It's prefect, at least I can make it prefect for all my needs. With no troubles or heartship. Everything just works like it suppose to. I'll never use anything else, Linux is the prefect OS."
Why do Linux users dislike Nvidia cards?,"Hi,
Right now I've been debating Linux for a long time on my next build. One thing I noticed is when I search for Linux gaming videos, almost all of them are with amd cards and I barely see any Nvidia Linux benchmark videos. Ive seen online that Linux users hate Nvidia because they don't have good Linux drivers. I personally want Nvidia for my next build because of DLSS and Path tracing. Im also not happy with how far behind fsr is with dlss and also how AMD doesn't seem to be doing anything to help game devs get fsr 3 in games. How well do Nvidia features like dlss 3.5 and ray tracing work in Linux?","""Ive seen online that Linux users hate Nvidia because they don't have good Linux drivers.""


That's the reason."
1 Year since I installed Ubuntu!,"It's been a year since I've dive into the world of linux computing. 

I tried first dual booting on my old thinkpad laptop. Immediately I noticed a significant increase in performance. After few weeks, I didn't even boot into windows and just removed it and continued using Ubuntu.

Then came the rabbit hole of discovering many distros, arch-based, fedora, debian. And then different Desktop Environment caught my eyes. I literally tried every single DE, and just testing which was the best use case for my workflow. And, Gnome was the absolute best for a modern desktop while also maintaining a good amount of performance and incredible user experience. 

Next, I found out about FOSS softwares and certain software worked so much better than the software I used in Windows. For example, Transmission torrent client is so simple but works amazingly well. LibreOffice is just so good as an alternative to MsOffice. I found almost every bit of FOSS software replacement I used in Windows. 

Every thing was so perfect, the theming of my OS, the flexibility, the stability of Ubuntu and software package management was so easy. 

I'm a mechanical engineering student. The software I need to use mostly is Matlab and Solidworks. For Matlab, I've found a replacement which is Octave. Octave works really well and was a great replacement. However, I couldn't find a good replacement for Solidworks. I've tried FreeCad and it's an amazing software but most of the engineering industry uses either Solidworks or AutoCad. 

This makes me sad bcs Linux was so perfect for me but tht one thing prevents me from fully converting to Linux. 

Although, I have to say Linux is the best for literally everything. Word processing, web browsing, coding, network shares, and so many others. 

The only thing that helds back Linux is tht most software tht are available in Windows should be also available in Linux. If that happens, I kid u not, Linux will be the biggest OS for desktop computing. The future is bright for Linux OS. Let's hope for the best 🤞","Dual booting is easily the best option. Tried to go full Linux too, but needed Fusion 360 for my 3D printing hobby and it's barely usable in a VM on Win10 on a very decent machine. Tried all Wine and derivatives options but nothing beats it running natively."
When people say learn Linux,what exactly do they mean? learn a few basic commands,"They mean either:

 1. Learn to do the things you do now, on some other OS, on Linux.
 2. Learn to be a sysadmin so you can make money."
"I am new to Linux, what should a beginner know?","I use Zorin OS. I don't know much about Linux except the basics. I want to know more about this OS and some useful terminal commands and also some cool software to enhance my experience. I don't do heavy tasks, just basic stuff like browsing the internet, photoshop, coding, etc.","+1 for public libraries: cheap when not entirely free access to all the books you can read ;)

You can easily (and legally) find ebooks too. To name just the first I stumble upon with a quick search:

https://itsubuntu.com/best-free-unix-ebooks-linux-ebooks/ (no idea what this post is worth, but it offers a lot of links)

All Linux distros come with a documentation that can be read even without internet access: in a terminal, type man name-of-the-command, to read its documentation. 
Be aware that even though very complete and instructive, man pages are not the most noob-friendly read there is.

Luckily, some distro also have very high quality documentation, like Debian (https://www.debian.org/doc/) and Arch (https://wiki.archlinux.org/). I learned a lot reading those.

All GNU documentation is available freely online:  
https://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html

GNU also propose books (for sale and free PDF):  
https://shop.fsf.org/collection/books-docs (edit: it looks like it offers links to printed/paid books only but in each book description you should find a link to the free PDF)

Finally, many authors have made the choice to share their work freely online.

One I consider a must read for any (serious) LibreOffice Writer user is Bruce Byfield *Designing with LibreOffice* in which he explains how to correctly use Styles: https://designingwithlibreoffice.com/. The book has recently been updated.

And so on ;)"
What is systemmd?,"I see this term being thrown around many linux subs, but I have no clue what that is... I see people saying it's bad, that they dont want, but at the end of the day I still have no clue what that is. Can someone explain to me who has never used Linux before? edit: Thanks everyone that has contributed :D","When you boot up Linux, it loads the kernel (the most basic part of the OS) into memory and starts an init (as in initialiser) system, which then has the job to load modules (like extra drivers) and system services, like the command line, the GUI, etc, until it drops you into a new session.
Back in the day, installing a more advanced distribution like Arch meant editing a bunch of scripts that the init system would go over in order. 

As complexity of the typical Linux desktop increased, there were more interdependent services that tended to slow down system startup or in some cases break it. There were several attempts to create better init systems like Ubuntu’s upstart service, and systemd is one such system, created for Fedora and Red Hat. It solved most aforementioned issues and established a new standard for creating and managing system services and is the standard init and service management system for most distributions.

There’s nothing “bad” about systemd: there was some push back because Linux users, especially system admins, don’t like people messing with their workflow, which the change to systemd did somewhat. Some vocal people in the community were dead set against it for a series of philosophical reasons. And because it was 2000s/early 2010s, the Linux community had a lot of hangers-on who didn’t really know much about the subject, but they enjoyed pontificating about it on Google Plus for clout. There were some people who actually went off and made their own systemd-free distros, but you rarely heard them wailing about how evil it was. Like a lot of Linux memes before and after it (“M$Windoze”, “Boycott Novel”, hating Canonical), it filtered down into the fertile substrate of Linux culture and occasionally emerges when a gatekeeping fanboi wants to prove they’re edgy."
What made you change?,"What was your main reason to change from Windows or Mac to the Linux Environment? For me it was speed and reliability of Linux.

Buying a new laptop specifically to install Linux?,"So I do have a decent amount of experience using Linux. I use Linux Mint as by primary os on my build.

What I'm looking for is a budget laptop/notebook focused on portability and installing mint or a similar distro as the only OS on that system.

I'm certain I can get anything on the market and do what I want to do. I want to know if there are any brands to look for (or avoid) when purchasing a new machine. Should I be mindful of hardware and the compatibility/support that hardware has with Linux? Any support is appreciated. Thank you.

Edit 1: budget <$750 Edit 2: I've only used AMD systems for almost 10 years. Any concerns with intel?

Edit 2.1: Nvidia?

Edit 3: Also, I started this discussion completely open to the idea that I may decide to support open-source, like StarLabs or System 76 I like what those guys are  doing

Hey all! Before you ask... did you read the man page? Here's how!,"tl;dr: If you are not familiar with terminal, and you prefer not to use it, this is not for you.

Okay, so I see a lot of posts on Reddit (not necessarily here ;) that are easily replied with a ""LMGTFY"" response (`let me google that for you`). And I see a lot more posts here where folks know which program to use for whatever, but don't know ""man"" (manual) pages.

I figured I'd just post this because I have actually \[and finally\] saved the method of exporting a man page to a text file. Which is now saved on my desktop next to a few man pages I had saved before.

In the terminal, type `man command_name > formatted_man_page.txt`. So, let's say we want to understand better how the `kill` command works, and why everyone is all about ""-9"". Open your terminal and type `man kill > /home/<USERNAME>/Desktop/kill_manpage.txt` and replace <USERNAME> with your own user name. This will dump the man page onto your desktop. You can then open it up with a text editor of your choice.

If you want to be more brutal (sorry, during these sequestering times, I've been watching some Metalcoalypse) and would prefer to stay in the terminal, Linux these days is super gracious. You can generally scroll around with your mouse, and PgUp/PgDn easily. But, if you'd like to search for a specific string (string being the exact characters you type in), use the command `/` and then type in your search query. Hit enter. To view the next option, hit `n`.  Sadly, I can't remember what the command is the find the previous entry, but ... hope this helps, and if you need to find the previous entry, I hope this inspires you enough to google and figure it out!

&#x200B;

Edit: THANKS ALL! There is some *GREAT* info in the comments; I really appreciate everyone's contribution, and I'm learning even more.","I would also add something that isn't intuitive about man pages. I've been using linux for around 20 years now, and didn't learn this until about 2 years ago.

Often times at the end of man pages you'll see references to other commands. Here is an example from my system typing in ""man systemd""

systemd-system.conf(5), locale.conf(5), systemctl(1), journalctl(1), systemd-notify(1), daemon(7), sd-daemon(3),
       systemd.unit(5), systemd.special(5), pkg-config(1), kernel-command-line(7), bootup(7), systemd.directives(7)

See all those numbers trailing the commands?

Those indicate the ""section"" of the man page you want to look at. Often times when you type in ""man command-name"" for some of the related commands, you don't get anything back.

That's because ""man command-name"" is usually the equivalent of typing in :

     man 1 command-name

Meaning, I want to see ""section 1"" of the man page.

Some man pages don't have a section 1, and some implementations of man don't assume you want any section of man page for the command.

You sometimes you have to explicitly tell man, you want to see a particular section. For example,

     man 5 locale.conf"
Change from Win 7 to Linux,"Greetings Guys.

Since Win7 support will be officially terminated next year, I decided to migrate to Linux. Not willing to get doxed by Win10 spyware OS.

Shouldn't be a big thing since I mostly use PC for gaming/entertaining issues.

So what's the most handy Distribution related to Win7 surface and compatibility?

I guess I check out that mint and pop_OS and will pick one of these.
Thanks alot again.","Linux mint is great. Easy, works out of the box per say, and being Ubuntu based it will be very simular. PopOS is definitely a distro I wanna try out.

then some dependencies:

sudo pacman -S alsa-lib gnutls lcms2 lib32-alsa-lib lib32-gnutls  lib32-lcms2 lib32-libldap lib32-mpg123 libldap mpg123 gendesk icoutils  imagemagick alsa-plugins lib32-alsa-plugins lib32-libpulse libpulse  openal lib32-openal 

after i did this LOL is working :-) With a lowered framerate compared to windows, probably because the driver natively supported for my Nvidia card isnt as good as in windows.. ill try to update the driver from the nvidia website later..

&#x200B;

Then for warcraft III

i did all this to fix LOL and then i tried to fix wc3 and it didnt want to install.. it couldnt connect with [battle.net](https://battle.net).

I used the warcraft III installation file provided by blizzard. ( if u have a legit key u can use this and then it will download wc 3 for you) . This wassent in anyway working.  no connection possible with [battle.net](https://battle.net)

"Have I, in fact, been pwned?","I run a small Ubuntu 16.04 server from an old laptop. It hosts a webpage that gets about one visit a week, a Jitsi server that I've last used more than a year ago, a half-put together and nonfunctional email server, and manages backups via rsync from some other devices. It's also a DNS server for some devices on my home network. SSH is on a very high port and I have fail2ban set up. It's logs don't indicate banning anyone recently.

Today I noticed on iftop some outgoing connections to various hosts connected to [poneytelecom.eu](https://poneytelecom.eu). I have read that this is a French hosting/network/telecom company also known as [online.net](https://online.net) and AS12876 that verges on being a crime syndicate with how many scams they allow to run (or perhaps run themselves). I have also seen some outgoing (mServer => suspicious host in iftop notation) connections to subdomains of [stretchoid.c](https://stretchoid.org)om, which I have read is also suspicious.

The transmissions are very small, under 100b, often under 10b. I ran software to detect rootkits, and didn't detect any, and there are no suspicious logs in auth.log, nor are there any suspcious processes running. My CPU and memory usage are close to zero, so I am not mining bitcoin for anyone, nor do I think I am sending spam. I created DENY OUT rules in ufw for all the known IP addresses for [poneytelecom.eu](https://poneytelecom.eu) but I seem to have missed some, as I saw another connection to a [poneytelecom.eu](https://poneytelecom.eu) subdomain.

Were they ""web"" connections (i.e. http on port 80 or https on port 443)?

You should try to figure out what process is making the connections, and/or sniff the traffic. If you can see connections happening in iftop, at the same time from a terminal try:

     sudo ss -anput

and that should tell you the processes associated with sockets.

Alternatively, you might be able to sniff and examine the suspect traffic with any number of programs made to do it. Examples include WireShark, TShark, and tcpdump. You might have to roll back your rule in ufw in order for these to see traffic, but at least you might get an idea of what is transpiring.

Edit: You can also drop the ""ut"" part in the above ss command and ss will show tons more stuff.
The t parameter is for TCP and the u parameter is for UDP. 
I usually use ""ut"" to make the ""a"" parameter (for all) not show all of the UNIX domain sockets, but still show the listening server sockets."

I decided to use Ubuntu on my desktop as my main OS.,"I've posted a few topics on running Linux distros on an old netbook. It's just too slow, and while iw3 ran well I am just too inexperienced.

I decided to jump into the deep end and use Ubuntu on my nicer machine. 10 GB of RAM vs 2 makes a big difference.

I was debating Linux Mint or some official flavor of Ubuntu such as Ubuntu MATE, or Xubuntu and I decided to go straight OG regular Ubuntu, in part because finding help topics is easier.

So far, so good. I have found replacement programs or learned to do without most things--nothing super critical. I decided syncing stuff to cloud services like Google Drive and OneDrive is not really necessary since both services have SaaS web apps I could use.

Yesterday I figured out how to install my printer and successfully dealt with a tarball, which felt like a big deal.

I dual booted, just in case there is anything I'll need from Windows yet. I'm going to try installing Windows 7 on VMs and if I can get that to work consistently I'll erase the dual boot partition.

I had a mild issue getting PDFs to work, but trying a few programs in the Ubuntu repository and I found something that works.

Part of my decision to switch is because as am learning R, a statistical programming language, which originates in Linux and is actually included in the repositories of most Linux distros.

That's because Linux can be installed in *almost anything*, but sometimes there isn't support for *some* hardware out of the box. It's a free and a community-driven initiative, after all. Think about it.

Speaking for myself: These issues tend to **motivate** me to learn more about computers in general and how to solve them.

Nowadays, I spend no more than 10 minutes solving driver issues in a fresh install because I already know how to do it from past experiences.

Now it runs like a charm and I frankly can't believe I got it to work, but trying to get used to it is hell on earth.

Which version of Linux most closely resembles the kind of Environment for software development?

Hello friends,

I am fairly new to this sub and a first-time poster. If I am breaking the rules in some way, I apologize in advance. 

I work in the tech field as a Technical Writer. My goal is to eventually write developer documentation. One of the most consistent ""preferred qualifications"" for these jobs is: ""Experience in a Linux/Unix Environment.""

I want to spend the next several months (years) familiarizing myself with Linux/Unix, however I don't know which version of Linux would most adequately reflect this qualification. 

I'm so new to this, that I'm not even sure if I'm asking the question right. I know some versions of Linux are easier than others - some even resemble Windows 10. So I'm curious which version is typical for use in software development (or at least is similar). 

Thanks for taking the time to read my post!Please let me know if you have any questions!

What donation startegy do you recommend for your favorite free software projects?,"So I've been using Linux for a while and believe its important to start giving back financially.  However I'm sort of confused how to go about this.

I have a set budget of $X a year; and I've been compiling a list of the free software that I use on a daily basis (from distro to browser plug-ins) that I would like to financially support.  I'm sure I've missed some because there are just so many I use.

But the biggest confusion is that I don't know how to allocate those funds.  You could argue that I should donate the most to the project that I use the most (in this case distro and DE), but the problem with that approach is that I feel those projects already get a ton of support (relatively) and maybe I should focus my efforts on the (seemingly) small proejcts that everyone ignores.

The problem with the latter approach is that, well $X isn't a lot, and I'm giving a fraction of that to a small project.  It really isn't enough to sustain the project by any means.  While I'm sure the gesture will be appreciated, I'm wondering if it will do any good?  

Also, what if these projects close, now I need to find an alternative and I'm out of cash also.  If Antergos closes, its large enough that a replacement (like Endeavor) will fork it and come in.  I'm not sure the same will happen for some of these niche phone software and browser plug-ins.

I'd be interested in hearing some feedback on how you guys recommend proceeding.  Is it really worth donating to FireFox, something that I use ALL the time, but already makes 9 figures from Google?  Will my pathetic donation mean anything to them?  

Thanks

Edit: If you guys want, I'd be interested in you sharing a list of the projects you donate to.  Just incase I've missed something.

Edit 2:  well its hypocritical for me to ask you guys to share your lists, but not share mine.  Here's what i'm looking at donating to (don't judge)

Firefox, Distro, KDE, EFF, Ublock Origin (they don't accept donations), Lutris, Lineage, TOR, Signal, Libre Office, NewPipe, & Simple Tools","Any project I use regularly I try to donate what the equivalent commercial package costs; i.e.,   LibreOffice gets whatever the annual Office 365 renewal happens to be.

This isn't a troll post. I'm honestly interested in the answers to it. Almost daily, you can read a posting here of someone that wants to dive into Linux and says that they are sick of Windows.

In hope that posting this here will actually get those of us who are looking for concise, understandable and honest answers, I ask: how do you choose a Linux distribution, as someone who has no knowledge of Linux in the first place (or may not even be tech-savy in the first place)?","you don't think about it that much and choose a popular one. you can check out this link: [https://distrochooser.de/en/](https://distrochooser.de/en/) , but even that won't give you a straight answer.

my advise is stick with ubuntu and ubuntu derivatives at first, such as mint, pop os, elementary. install the one you like its looks the most. if you value customization check kubuntu. if you want something lightweight check xubuntu or lubuntu."
Apt vs. apt-get,What’s the difference and should I update/upgrade both?,"Use apt whenever you can. There are a few things apt-get can do that apt cant but you likely wont need them, plus apt has a nice progress bar."
How do you bring up that system info thing in the terminal which everyone has on r/unixporn?,"EDIT::: Found it, it's called ScreenFetch and you can install it with 




>sudo apt install screenfetch






then typing in

Why did mobile linux apparently freeze at around 2020?,"mobile linux distros were consistently supporting new devices until around 2020, after that it seems to have frozen for some reason.

[in the postmarketOS wiki](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Devices) the last supported commercial device is the Xiaomi POCO X3 from 2020.

Most mobile distros recommend the google pixel 3a from 2019. There have been 7 pixels out after that. Why aren't newer phones supported? Is there any hardware change that is preventing newer devices from being supported?","Probably because fewer and fewer manufacturers allow to unlock the bootloader now. 

And those that do are probably too new to be supported by linux. Even the Snapdragon X Elite, a laptop chip from last year, still isn’t fully supported (blame Qualcomm)."
I'm planning to go full on linux without previous experience,"Hey, l never use linux before and I really hate windows. Can I just ditch windows and use mint? Is there a learning curve or will I miss anything?","Yes. If you just use it as a basic computer, you'll be fine. If you need things made for Windows you may find hiccups. Be willing to use the program that works for what you're doing. Example: Using LibreOffice instead of Excel for spreadsheets. It should come with most of what you need.

Also, install apps from the ""store."""
"what is ""git"" and what is the difference between ""git"" and ""github.com""?","hello, quick question 

what is ""git"" and what is the difference between ""git"" and ""[github.com](https://github.com)""? 

i'm not understanding the difference, is git a repository? a program? another website? 

thank you","`git` is a program that is used to track changes in code. It's very useful and allows you to ""go back in time"" if something is broken and see what's changed which might have caused it to break. It's also very handy when several people work on the same code together, they can share their changes easily.

GitHub is a website, now owned by Microsoft, that you can use with git. There are other websites like it, e.g. GitLab. All of them allow you to put your changes on their servers to make it easier to share them with other people. They may also have other features like more advanced permissions so you can only share your code with specific people, or build platforms where you can automatically build your program after you've pushed new code to them."

The Linux filesystem totally confuses me. What is the Linux equivalent of Windows's C: drive?,I want to get familiar with Linux but the filesystem is totally foreign. Where is my C drive? What are all the different folders? I'm so confused,"As for the role of each directory, you can read about it there :

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard?wprov=sfla1

Linux filesystem is quite complex compared to windows. It's because in linux ""everything is a file"" (like in other Unix-like OS). You interact with the hardware by writing and reading files in /dev, the same with process management (they are all stored in the /proc directory). When you think about it, it's quite a simple and beautiful way to organize things. But it makes everything visible to the user, so it can be confusing at first."
Moving from Microsoft to Linux After 40 Years,"I've been using Microsoft products since 1984. I did some work with Novell Netware, and Avvion UNIX machines in the 90s, but 99% of my life has been in Windows. Win11 is a deal breaker for me.

I have two HP laptops that are my primary machines: an HP Spectre and an HP Spectre Folio. Both have touchscreens (not a deal breaker if I can't get that to work). 

In addition to migrating away from Windows, I plan to migrate off Office (currently using Office 2021 not O365). I need a good word processor as I'm an author in my free time. 

Finally, I'm an audiophile with an extensive FLAC library. It's house on a QNAP NAS. 

Any recommendations on a preferred Linux? Zorin OS, Linux Mint and Solus have been recommended. But each seems to have pluses and minuses. For Office, WPS Office seems to be the one to beat, but I'm open to options. Biggest thing is ability to open DOCX files. I've been using MediaMonkey for years and love it, but it doesn't support Linux. I'm more focused on playlist creation and file management with this. One that was recommend was Elisa but it is for KDE, I'm not sure how it would work on others.

Thanks in advance!","Mint for sure, it was my first distro and I think it’s one of the best in terms of easing into the Linux space.

Solus I wouldn’t use as your first, not because it’s hard to use but because their software repositories don’t come close to other distros, meaning you’ll be relying on using Flatpaks instead of installing things natively. (Which isn’t bad, mind you, just inconvenient sometimes.)

LibreOffice is really good, it’s what I’ve been using for years now, it both works and can export to .docx.

Welcome aboard!"
Last used linux regularly was around 2010 and I'm thinking of coming back. What's changed?,"I started with Ubuntu to get me hooked and then ended up in Slackware because I was young and edgy. I would mess around and personalize my install until it was barely usable and then start over practically every month. Spent lots of time with different Window Managers and themes. Compiz was big for me. Spent a lot of time tinkering with Wine trying to get MS Office, etc. to work. I went back to Windows because I was tired of breaking my Linux install every other week.

Now I'm older and wiser and thinking about switching over. I've spent the intervening years tinkering with Raspberry Pi's so I'm still pretty familiar with unix systems.

Any CLI programs for daily use?,"I was drawn to cli for trivial reasons (to look like hacker) but after encountering instaloader ,yt-dlp and gallery-dl I fell in love with it, it is so powerful and convenient, I believe best way to learn cli is through using it for essential things.

I'm using Mint for about 2 years. It just works. Should I distro-hop?,Should I feel bad for not being a Gentoo chad? I don't have any problems with Mint. Do I have any reason to use another more 'advanced'(like Arch/Gentoo) distro? Am I missing something?,"If you are happy with Mint, Stick with Mint. Anyone who says anything is being an elitist, and is hurting the Linux community as a whole. 

I have hopped across the board, and frankly it all felt the same after awhile. Finally landed on Pop os, and am happy; it works for my needs, and have not felt the need to switch for awhile. 

If Mint works with your flow, enjoy it and keep on carrying on. If it begins to no longer work with you, explore. 

Now, one caveat: I generally spin up VMs to try out new distros, so I cannot say I NEVER explore. I mostly do it to try new features of other DEs, since there are so many creative people in the *nix community. If you want to do the same, Virtualbox or qemu is your friend here."
Should I buy a 'Linux Command Line Second edition' book by William Shotts?,"Although I am a Windows user, I am very interested in Linux. It is a beautiful operating system and it's crazy what freedom you have in it as I've read about it. I tried Ubuntu and Manjaro distoros, but as I've learned my lesson, Linux as the operating system may be complex and difficult for new user. Hell, I didn't and still I don't know how to install things on it, but once I somehow succeeded in installing Minecraft on it. Then, I found this book - Linux Command Line: Complete Introduction. It's well rated book and I am interested in it, I am interested in learning about this beautiful OS more. Is it worth it?","That book is available freely online... and it is on its sixth edition by now.

How is customization achieved in Linux?,"I installed Linux a week ago or so (Manjaro KDE), and have been trying to learn to customize the way it looks (I didn't know 'desktop' was a different thing from the OS). I found a subreddit and was exploring i.e. r/unixporn. As I tried to copy the way some looks were, they gave links to GitHub (idk what that is) and something called 'dotfiles'.As a Windows user, I used to customize using Rainmeter, and as with any windows thing, I just hit install and went through the options of customization after installation. But I have no idea how to achieve customization in Linux given its technical modes. Like what are dotfiles and compositor, what am I supposed to do with them, will there be a menu to customize or do I have to write lines of code, what is GitHub etc. After using Linux I realized that what as an average bloke one thinks of one's system is actually a finished product, i.e. I used to think that the entire UI, the file manager, the taskbar (panel) is the OS, but after using Linux, I realized that those things are separate, and I'd just like to learn more and learn to use them. Thank you :)","Each program likely has its own configuration for visuals. KDE makes some of it easier but providing a settings panel, but many programs use files for configuration, often called ""dotfiles"" because they are usually files that start with a period (or they're in folders that start with a period), which your file browser will hide by default. If you go into your home folder and enable hidden files, you might be able to start opening some and take a peek at how you might configure some of them. People use GitHub because it makes it easy to track these files and show them to other people. Lucky for you, this means you can compare your dotfiles with those from other users on GitHub!

EDIT: Some other notes:

A desktop environment is a collection of programs, usually containing a Window Manager, which does nothing more but tell the computer where to position the windows on screen, and a compositor, which will hook into the computer to tell it how to render the windows. A compositor is not necessary, but you do need it for nice graphical effects like shadows.

KDE has those and much much more to make it a very full desktop environment."

Did you have 'the Linux dude'?,"I started using Linux almost 5 years ago. It started me inheriting a raspberry pi 3 and I had it roaming the flat for a few months until I had some spare time and thought ""We can't have that, let's try to do something cool with it.""  
I read a start-up guide and followed some tutorials. After a few weeks, I came to appreciate the terminal, the precision, the automation and scripting, and thought ""I want that for my desktop.""

Since Raspbian is Debian-Based, I just went with Debian and never looked back since.  
I broke the system 2-3 times in the first few months and then never again. Good thing the first thing I learned is how to make and apply backups. Whenever I encountered an error, I lived with it until the weekend and then set some time to fix it. It was only recently that I started documenting my fixes, because some of them kept repeating once I built a new PC.

Last year, I got two of my friends interested in Linux, who then went for POP!\_OS and now I find myself being the Linux-guy. Virtually any problem that took me hours of reading and testing, which they encounter, is now fixed with ""Here, c&p this line and here's a documentation if you're interested in how this works.""  
Didn't take much time for them to pick up most of the essential skills, and yet I always think to myself ""If only I had someone to always point me to the solution, I could've saved tremendous amounts of time"", although playing detective was fun!

Did you have 'the Linux dude' or do you have someone who is?  
What's your experience with it?  
Looking forward to your comments!","When I started, which was actually before the first official distro, we had the BBS and just chatted with each other to figure things out."
"So, what does it mean to be proficient with Linux?","Every so often, I come across a distro or smth where the recommendation is to only use it if you're proficient with Linux. I've been using Linux Mint for everything for the past year, and tbh I haven't really needed to learn much in the way of new skills. Am I proficient in Linux? I'm guessing not. Is there some skill check list? Even just a direction to point myself in would be helpful -- I thought that at some point I'd feel less out of my element in Linux discussions, but that has yet to come. 

For context: I'm really just a tech-curious random, I don't have a particularly technical job or any real need for these skills. I just like to know things, and tend to pick projects at random to throw myself at.","It's more or less a question of ""have you had to go fix things moderately deep into the system enough to know how it generally works so you won't have a bad time?""

Anyone, experienced or not, can use a distribution like Arch. But unless you know things like how disk formatting works, how to navigate and edit text in the command line, and how to make sure an update won't break your system (+ backup strategy), you might be banging your head against a wall for a while before you can use it *comfortably*"
Snap Store is Flaming Garbage,"I've decided to bite the bullet and fully migrate to Linux, specifically Ubuntu, as it's A. what I have experience in and B. what I have experience in.

I started up my PC after doing the installation and decided, ""Oh, I'll just use the Snap Store to install my usual apps."" That was a horrible idea. I use my PC mostly for gaming, so I installed Steam, I was able to download just about everything I needed.

The only major issue was that it wouldn't load saves and wouldn't actually write any saves to my disk. I changed multiple settings, to no avail. After about 4 hours of trying things, I just decided to uninstall and then install using the .deb that Valve has listed on the Steam downloads page. Instant fix.

Prior to that, I attempted to uninstall Steam via the Snap Store. The app legitimately wouldn't uninstall.

I had to reboot, attempt to uninstall again, then finally give up on the store itself and just uninstall it via the terminal. Holy hell, is that a pile of flaming garbage? I would've thought since it seems like they pushed it as this ""easy and effective way to install your apps!"" that it would be functional. Boy, was I wrong.

EDIT: I appreciate all the help and advice from you all, but minor update. I wasn't even able to update the snap store through the option IT PROVIDED. I killed the stores background process and then installed it via terminal, which again isn't a problem, but it would be for a brand new less than techy person were to attempt to use it.","This is why I don't use Ubuntu, I wish they would just go with flatpak like the rest of the Disros have done.

I can see now why Windows is so full of itself...,"The culture shock is great. All I'm trying to do is get permission for my other hard drives to allow me in, but they won't. I've been going over and over drwx and chmod and sudo until I see the letters in my sleep, but I still can't get permissions of my other drives. Either the drives \`don't exist\` or I don't have permissions- again! it's all root, root, root, I'm sick of root!

How can this 'simple' process be so hard? It's actually driving me to drink! And I don't drink!

I've stuck up a pic if it'll help at all?

UPDATE edit: Too many responses to reply to them all, and I've been busy reinstalling, etc, over hours, some comments are helpful and great, some not quite so much. No problem, I have a thick skin. It's the net and to be expected. Some people clearly seem to want Linux to fail and are watching from Window's land...hmmm. I'm not going back to Windows, M$. Not so sure about my friends though...

Thanks to those who've helped, you give me hope. :) No thanks to the rude ones who are actively helping keeping new Linux users away. :(

Anyway, one way I've managed to gain access is to go into my drives and tell it to give me access as \`Root\` then it gives me Elevated privileges and I'm in! Finally I can add files, delete, etc. So I'm getting there. I will learn the rest.

# Update SOLVED.

# Special thanks to unit_51 who was patient and did not falsely accuse me who pointed me right with one particular instruction of: ""If these are native Linux filesystems, just take ownership. Make sure all the drives are mounted (click on them in the file manager) and run sudo chown -R xira:xira /run/media/xira to make yourself the owner of every drive. You shouldn't even need to change permissions, as long as you're the owner you should already have read-write access.

Anyone suggesting chmoding it to 777 clearly has no understanding of UNIX permissions and they're going to learn it the hard way sooner or later.""

and

# ""Try deleting the /run from the file path, Mint might be using /media instead of /run/media. If that still doesn't work, run lsblk to list the mount points.""

Thankyou, Sir.","Almost none of those terminal commands are correct. You should probably spend a few minutes on the web and find a tutorial on basic Linux drive and file system management.

Some points:

1. ""Fixed"" drives (vs. removable) should be mounted using /etc/fstab and unless they have a special purpose they should be mounted to locations under /mnt/. This is all about organization and following standards. Of course, it is *your* system and you're free to do as you please but the farther you wander from expected norms the more likely you are to encounter problems.
2. When using /etc/fstab to mount file systems you need to learn a bit about mount options to both optimize the file system but also ease access. For example, using the options ""user"" and/or ""users"" will allow you to mount and unmount those file systems without ""sudo"" and a password.
3. ""/media/<username>"" is where the system automounts removable devices. Mucking about there will likely result in your thumb drives not being mounted anymore.
4. If you are using EXT4 you need to modify the ownership of the file system the first time you mount it so your user can easily access it. If you have multiple users, you'll want to consider group permission and access rather than user level ownership.
5. EXT4 also reserves 5% of the total space for ""system"" use which is an antiquated default on only marginally necessary on a bootable file system and not at all on a file system used only for storage. You should free all the reserved space on storage file systems with ""sudo tune2fs -m 0 /dev/sdX1"" substituting your partition device name for ""sdX1"".
6. File systems are ""easier"" to access in Windows because Windows default controls are inherently unsafe. That's why a virus can wipe your file systems in Windows but hasn't ever happened when using Linux."
what's the appeal or Arch?,"Why is Arch getting so popular? What's the appeal (other than it just  being cooler than ubuntu, because ubuntu is for n00bs only!). What am  I  missing out?



The difference between the more user-friendly distros seem to be so minor... Different **default** window managers and different package management systems (and package formats). I  use Ubuntu just because I was happy with apt even before the first  version of Ubuntu came out (and even *before* that rpm was such a trauma that I still remember the pain).



Furthermore, 3rd party software  is usually distributed in deb+rpm+""run this shell script on your generic linux"". I prefer deb, and nowadays many even have private apt repos  (docker, dbeaver, even steam. to name a few), so you get updates ""out of  the box"".



But granted I don't know nothing about Arch. So why is it preferred nowadays?","Honestly the AUR is a huge one for me. If a software is on linux then chances are its in the AUR. Pacman is also one of (or the?) fastest for downloading and installing updates, though you do spend more total time updating since you do it so often so a grain of salt there. The wiki is also incredibly useful.

Other than that it's really just customizability and choosing things yourself right at installation. I wouldn't say it's radically better or anything close to that, its just different in a way that appeals to some while still being popular enough to be very well documented."
Is it a good idea to install linux on a brand new gaming laptop?,"I've been thinking of switching to linux but I was born and raised with windows, and my legion 5 is going to arrive in 2 weeks, but when I did some search, most videos said that linux would work better on an older laptop, and I would have to check for hardware compatability ect...

Honest answers please: how much tinkering does one have to do in order to just use linux like a layman?,"Is it a matter of constant tinkering and fixing things, or can it ""just work"" kind of how a mac does?

One reason I'm so glad I switched from Windows to Mac is I was spending too many hours of my life fixing problems just to get the OS to work smoothly. I've done literally 0 hours of fixing problems in the 7 years I've used mac os. 

So as a prospective linux convert for privacy reasons (especially after Big Sur showing the privacy violation route apple has chosen, and I don't think it's going to change), I'm wondering how many hours of my life I should expect to waste per month with linux tinkering so I can weight the pros and cons of a switch.","I'm a total hack. I play with computers but it's obvious why this was never a career.

Your experience will depend on the Linux distribution you choose. Linux is sort-of the core brains of the system, but it gets adapted into all sorts of distributions (think of them like ""versions"") for different purposes. There's family trees that show how different versions evolved from prior versions. But for basic desktop use, most of that won't matter because the system will manage that stuff for you.

For basic desktop use, I like Ubuntu. It's based on Debian, which is a very stable foundation, but is very user-oriented. It has a good software manager. Other similar versions are Mint or Peppermint, and each has it's niche.

Others like OpenSUSE, which I used to love, but that was probably because they have a cool logo. I really don't know much else about how it's come along. Fedora is the community edition of Red Hat, which is one of the early big names in Linux. Any web search for ""linux distributions for new users"" or something like that will give you some rundowns on the options.

I would avoid ones like Arch, Slack, or Gentoo, that I think require more technical expertise.

There are really tons of versions for different purposes. Have an old computer that can't keep up? Try Damn Small Linux or such. Do you want something that is plug-and-play, or lets you dig under the hood?

If you're really nervous, you can download Ubuntu and put on a DVD or flash drive, and I think when that boots up, it gives you a choice to try it or install. Or setup a virtual machine on your PC and try all sorts of Linux distributions - try one, dump it, and try another.

The main thing to remember is it's all same but different. Like how when Microsoft upgrades Windows or Excel, and everyone loses their mind because it doesn't look quite the same. It still does all the same stuff, and a little thinking will get you there. So instead of Microsoft Office, you might use Libre Office. Still does word processing and spreadsheets, but maybe options are under the Format menu instead of File.

There will be problems, just like with anything else in computers. If you stay in the mainline distributions, a web search usually finds lots of resources from people that have had that problem before you."
What was your path of going from an absolute beginner to master of the linux terminal?

Please let me know how you got started and how you have managed to improve your skills.,"I'm not considering myself a master of the linux terminal but I can easily operate without a gui (if we exclude documentation reading online).

So...how did you get here?,"Hey guys & gals. I thought I'd take a different approach in my question asking today and start with something easy.

Concerning Linux and whatever DE of choice you made, how did you get here...and become a Linux user?

For me, it started on Youtube watching a video on optimizing Windows 10 by Chris Titus Tech. I saw he had a few other videos talking about Linux so out of curiosity I watched a few. I learned what I suspected about Windows 10, heard how much better Linux ran compared to Windows, and discovered gaming on Linux was not only possible but enjoyable as well!

After that, I followed his playlist about installing Linux and haven't looked back. I know very little about Linux but I'm enjoying learning about it, especially with customizing it. Several months ago, I knew Reddit existed but I never used it. Now I'm subscribed to multiple forums and browsing every day looking for new stuff to learn and try....and of course to ask for help every other day! ;)

But enough about me...what about you?

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for sharing! I try to make it a habit to respond to what people post (within reason and not just to make noise) but the amount of responses has been amazing (AKA a lot!) and also awesome! I'm very happy I switched to Linux and honored to be here. :)","Six months after installing Win95 I got bored. I installed Slackware 3.0 and have been running Linux ever since. It's been both fun and challenging that entire time. You'll have a great time with it. And, if you haven't bookmarked it already (and I really wish it existed in 1996): https://linuxjourney.com/"
"Why do most Linux distributions identify themselves as ""ubuntu"" in the UEFI boot menu?","For Ubuntu, it's fine of course. I don't get the rest, even if they are in fact based on Ubuntu. Why does Linux Mint call itself ""ubuntu"" in the boot menu?",They are based on Ubuntu and they either haven't changed the grub entry or if grub guesses the distro based and the output of a variable or a command - they haven't changed that
"What tools are there on Linux for monitoring CPU, RAM, GPU, VRAM etc.?","Basically title, I can't find anything about good programs for monitoring system usage.","In a terminal, you can run `htop`, this gives you a very decent overall look at your running processes, how much ram they take up, and so on.

another popular option is to use [conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky), it puts the information on the desktop, it has its own scripting language, allowing you make layouts however you want, but there are also tons of premade ones you can use, [heres what I have on my second screen](https://i.imgur.com/CqfHT4S.png)"
What grabbed you about Linux?,"I've been using Kali for a few days, and though I've tried a couple of other Linux distros over the years, they've never grabbed me before. 

Yes, I know Kali 'isn't for beginners', but I have a lot of experience with computers, and I've learnt more just messing about with Kali for a few days than I have for years. I feel excited, like back when I was a kid just delving into the filesystems on Windows 95 and seeing what was there...

However, I think I've had a light switch on in my brain whilst learning to use the terminal.

I just fixed a bunch of stuff by typing a couple of lines and hitting enter. The computer went off and got what it needed to fix a broken installation, and took care of business.

That is so cool, and powerful!

Would have taken ages to do a similar thing on Windows...

Think I love Linux now...

What was it that grabbed you about Linux?","I was initially drawn towards it because both MS and Mac had done things to annoy me. Now I love it because I can tailor my computer to suit my needs exactly. It's the logical conclusion for somebody like me who custom-builds their PC, not because they want the best gaming experience, but because it's custom-suited to a set of particular tasks (for me, image editing).

FWIW Kali is intended for pen testing and security, and some of the things that's it's designed for don't make it an ideal daily driver. So, if you decide to go to Linux as primary platform, I wouldn't recommend Kali."
Are we too confortable with the terminal?,"Just a thought I had when switching back to Ubuntu after career needs and hardware limitations had me between mac and windows for a while.

Gotta say getting back has been nice and I found we now have much better out-of-the-box support. But still I had a few quirks to solve in my setup that led me to a few hours of troubleshooting and I couldn't help but notice the difference.

Pretty much every solution that I found (and they were planty, yey!) were presented as ""just run this obscure series of commands in the terminal"". Now, I work as a programmer and I'm pretty confortable with a terminal, but I couldn't help but wonder how could I possibly reccomend a switch to linux to anyone not technically inclined? 

Most of the same solutions btw could have been achieved via a GUI, most of them involving doing edits to a file. Or even just digging in the system settings.

It's true that copy-pasting in the terminal is faster but, are we turning away people by only presenting that as a solution? Am I the only one thinking this?","Terminal commands are frequently used because they're the only consistent interface. Entering a couple commands is faster, more universal, and less likely to become out of date than providing instructions that only work with a certain version of a certain desktop environment."

"Everyone tells you how to install apps from source code, but nobody bothers to say why. Why the extra work?","In windows, you just let the installer guide you along.

Why should I want to compile from source code? Can't I just use the build? I mean, build is just compiled source code. Why the extra steps?","If a binary package of the program you want is available for your version of your distro and you trust the person who provides that package as much as you trust the original developer (and you don't want to make any modifications yourself), then I see little reason to build it yourself. But not all of that is true for every program."
A notepad ++ equivalent for Linux?,"My day job is windows with a bit of Linux here and there but my home life is all Linux, and I miss notepad ++. It's the only windows app I use regularly that always impresses me.

Currently I use gedit, and I'd say it's good, but I still miss notepad ++. I've researched this a little, looks like there are some knockoffs and an older port with so-so reviews. There's also the wine possibility, but I much prefer native  apps of art all possible.

"Why do some files (usually files not native to Linux, like a .txt, or a code file like .py) have file endings? Most other files in Linux don't, so why do some files have them, and why does Linux know what to do with them?","So I was taught that files in Linux don't need file endings like in Windows because every file has an identifier on it's first line (if you think of the file as a text document, which all files can be. a non-text file will just be garbled text though) that lets the OS recognize the file as a picture or text file or whatever. 

But some files, usually ones that I've sent to my Linux from my Windows (like a .jpg) or a code file, retain their file endings. Moreover, the file endings actually have some impact on how Linux views them (the file endings aren't just viewed as part of the file name). For example, changing a .py file to a .class file will actively make Linux interpret that file as a file containing code for Java and not Python.

I'd think that Linux doesn't even have the ability to identify files based on the extension in their name, since it doesn't need to do that (since identifiers are in the files anyways). So what's going on here? Why does changing the file ending do anything, when Linux doesn't rely on file endings at all?","For the why, two reasons, makes it easier for humans to identify a file just by looking at the filename but also useful for programs to the same kind of file but with different purpose. Java sourcecode, python sourcecode, c++ sourcecode...that are all just text. And identifying the exact programming language in them can be complicated (java and c++ have a lot of keywords in common, it's no trivial to see if a program is written for Java or c++). So by having file extensions it is a lot easier for editors to turn on the correct syntax highlighting for a specific language for example.

So, why do people always say that linux (unix) has no file extensions? Well, because there really aren't any...You have one filename and that filename can end in dot-something but it has no special meaning at all. It's not like the FAT filesystem where each file has a filename and an extra data field for the extension. The file extension in unix filesystems is simply a part of the filename. And file extensions don't have to be done by "".<something>""...for example vim creates backup files simply by adding a ""~"" at the end of the filename. The ""extension"" in this case is only ""~"" without any dot.

The traditional way of identifying a file on unix is by ""magic numbers"". You have a long list of ""byte combinations"" and something reads the start of a file then compares it to that list to see what the file really is. The `file` tool for example does this...you can have a look at the magic number list in `/usr/share/misc/magic`. That folder has text files for all filetypes `file` can identify which tell `file` what numbers it has to find in the start of a file to identify it as this filetype.

But that is not the end of it....nowadays there is a second system for identifying files: shared-mime-info. This is mostly used by DEs and their programs. And mimetypes defined by this database can either be defined again by magic numbers but also by filename patterns. The database files for this system you can fin in `/usr/share/mime` (or if you modify them on your user account in `~/.local/share/mime`). And if you look at examples there most contain a `<glob pattern=""*.png""/>` line or similar. That means  any program using the mimetype database will identify png images by matching he filename against a ""*.png"" pattern. Filename matching is simply faster than having to open a file and look at the start...so for your filemanager being able to display the ""filetype"" column in time this is nicer...even if it doesn't guarantee that the file is really a png image."
Can i use linux on a new pc if i don't game ?,"I only do a little shopping online and youtube and Online banking, would a linux distrow cover these and can i install it on a computer with ssd inside

Many thanks","Yes, web browsers work mostly the same on Linux as on Windows/Mac. Some DRM (paid content streams) might not work, for example Netflix is lower quality, and HBO Now is unavailable. YouTube works perfectly, along with online apps (banking, Google Docs, Facebook, etc.).

"[PSA] dd is super, mega, ultra, fucking destructive. Be careful!","Lots of people (myself included, actually) are recommending that newbs use dd for various things, from making a boot USB to cloning harddrives.

That's all well and good, and if you know what you're doing, dd is fucking amazing.

But if you don't know what you're doing: **entering the wrong file for `of` can be catastrophic**.

dd literally just takes bytes from `if`and writes them to `of`. It doesn't care what it's overwriting, it doesn't care if there's a partition table in the way, or a boot sector, or a home folder.

So, be careful. Triple check the command you're about to enter, and only then execute it.","> Instead of referring to drives as ""8GB removable drive"" or ""256GB SSD with all my files"" it just calls them by bland unremarkable names like /dev/sda and /dev/sdb.

That is not dd's fault. People are free to use /dev/disk/by-id/ to refer to devices if they want a more verbose name.

It's the lowest-level piece of an operating system. It has more privileges than anything else, and is responsible for coordinating everything that runs on the computer.

Read through x86 documentation and dig through the [osdev wiki](http://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page)

> How do you configure it?

(assuming you're talking about the Linux kernel) Without recompiling it, you can configure it with kernel flags (set in/by your bootloader) or by interfacing with `/sys` after the system has booted.

> Where is my Kernel?

probably `/boot/vmlinuz-linux`

> Can I look at it?

Yes, but it's a compiled ELF binary and isn't really human readable.

> Can I change it?

Yes, but not easily. If you want to mess with the kernel, you'll want to mess with the original C source and then [compile your own](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=compiling+your+own+linux+kernel).

Probably not.

Anything you want. Although you're probably referring to the builtin configuration options, in which case check out the configuration tools included with the kernel source."

My thoughts after a couple of days with Pop OS,"SO I've been on Pop OS on my main desktop for a few days now.  Little under a week to be exact.  First the things I'm surprised about.  

&#x200B;

1: Hardware support OMG.  I was so surprised when I installed the OS that my wireless peripherals were detected.  I was expecting to have to plug in wired versions in order to download drivers for the wireless stuff.  Plus my GTX 1080ti was picked up automatically too! Wow!

&#x200B;

2: Game support.  Every game I've tried has worked, with the exception of Borderlands 3 which has some texture loading issues when loading into new areas.  But with that one exception everything works.  Just Cause 4? Yes!, No Man's Sky? Well of course!  Planetary Annihilation Titans? Definitely!  Love it.

&#x200B;

3: Freedom.  Not having to pay the OS or any license keys in the future to unlock basic functionality is a revelation.

&#x200B;

4:  Security.  The possibility of getting a virus is greatly reduced.  Not having to run an antivirus when I download something is amazing.  I know it is possible to get a virus, but the fact that it's Open source, so anybody and everybody looks at the code for vulnerabilities, is great.

&#x200B;

Next the one thing I'm disappointed with.

&#x200B;

No affinity photo/designer and with that no driver support for my huion kamvas pro 16 tablet.  I practice drawing with krita or the affinity apps all the time and not having the particular hardware support is disappointing to say the least.  Overall, I'm loving my switch to a Linux based OS.  I use windows on my laptop still, but less and less.  I'm even thinking about installing Pop OS on the laptop as well.","It appears there is a community built driver for that line of drawing tablets: https://github.com/joseluis/huion-linux-drivers

Also there is a Linux version of Krita as well has Inkscape for vector-based drawing."
Users that switched from Windows to Linux - what are your reasons?,"Junior Dev here.
I have been using Windows all my life both as regular user (entertainment and so on) and developer (I used Java, .NET Core, C++ for Embedded and Native Android Development, I also used tools for the complete game development toolchain both as hobbyist and professional).
I used ubuntu (windows subsystem) once in a project where the redis database was involved but I did not do a lot with it.

I really don't know anything about linux and at some points thought it would be worth giving it a shot. What's been holding me back ever since was that I really did not see a rational need for me to do so - so I just didn't.

My Question is - people that have switched from windows to any linux system/type/distro (what's it even called?) - what are the reasons and advantages in doing so (maybe aside the fact that it's free)? Also, are there some disadvantages to it? 

When is it appropiately to use linux or where are its strong points compared to windows?

I'm really hoping to get some insightful answers (and please don't bash). Thanks in advance.

What exactly does that mean? A quick google says that a unix environment has a kernel, a shell and a file system. Doesn't nearly all modern OS have something like that? And I get a tautological definition from Wikipedia ""A Unix-Like OS is one that behaves similar to a unix system."" 

  
As an amateur JS/web developer using windows 10 and now messing with Python I'm not savvy enough to know why I want a unix like environment. 

  
Why do people suggest developers use a unix like system like Macs, and what the heck is a unix like system?","It means a system with a kernel that exposes the standard UNIX (or POSIX) API.

Systems that are not unix-like do things differently regarding files, processes， memory, pipes, etc.  Thus their API will be completely different. 

For example, Windows has massive API sets that look like `WinGetMeACupOfTea` while UNIX has `open`... 

Beware, older versions of Windows do expose a UNIX-like API. So it is a chameleon."
Is it worth switching to linux as a developer?,"Hey guys, I am currently learning backend development (specifically web) and Im wondering is it worth switching to linux from windows. If so, what are the benefits of switching to linux and should I use a VM?","I'm a senior back end developer, also responsible for the while DevOps, adminstration and security of our system...

All our servers run on CentOS or RHEL, and the fact that my computer behaves exactly the same as our production servers is a blessing. Things that run on my laptop are guaranteed to work on the build server or the production servers.

Here's everything you should know about Lemmy and the Fediverse: https://lemmy.world/post/37906","tldr; Linux will 'hold' files that are actually deleted until hooks to the processes touching them are killed.

Pacstall v1.5 released! 🚀,"Greetings all,

I'm one of the developer of [Pacstall](https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall), which aims to be a new kind of package manager for Ubuntu based distributions. 

# What is Pacstall? Why do I even need it?
Pacstall is a package manager for Ubuntu based distributions, and installs packages using pacscripts, similar to PKGBUILD for AUR. Pacstall aims to fill the gap between AUR and Flatpaks. 

Pacstall takes in files known as pacscripts that contains the necessary contents to build packages, and builds them into executables on your system.

All pacscripts are stored [in a GitHub repo](https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall-programs). Pacscripts need to go through two layer security check. We use pacscript to install the package using workflows and in VMs to ensure that all pacscripts are safe and don't cause any harm to your system. You can submit pacscripts by creating a pull request. You can be sure that your system will not have any issues when installing package using pacstall. 

Pacstall contains many packages that are not in apt repos or require using PPAs. It also has packages like neovim-git which requires manual compiling. 

# Hmm, looks interesting. Tell more. 
We have released version 1.5 of Pacstall yesterday. It introduced some of the best features we can ever imagine. Sneak peek of some features:

* Parallel downloads using ```aria2```

* Multi repo support

* Support for ```.deb``` files, and so much more....

Edit: You can create your own repo and use it to install packages from pacscripts.",Is there a relationship between this and the Debian User Repository project?

Learning More About Linux Through Linux From Scratch,"I have been interested in learning more about Linux for a while now and I really want to gain an understanding of what Linux is and how building on top of the kernel works.

"At last! A fix for 2K (and possibly other) screen scaling on X11. No tearing, no blur.","The biggest downside of Linux for me right now is the handling of fractional scaling, especially in GNOME which I love and use. 

Enabling scaling in Wayland results in blurry xWayland apps like Chrome. Enabling scaling in Xorg always ended in screen tearing and lack of overall smoothness. Text scaling isn't enough because it won't scale buttons and other UI elements and 200% scaling (the only one functioning out of the box)  resulted in an unusable abomination of a desktop on my 2K laptop screen. 

Searching the nets for the 1000th time I found this little app on github. 

[HiDPI fixer](https://github.com/alex-spataru/HiDPI-Fixer)

And it did it! No tearing, everything is smooth and looks the way it should with 150% scaling which is optimal for me.

Unfortunately only works with Xorg for now. As I understand it, the app creates a fake resolution and then scales it.

The installation is super easy. You just download the AppImage and run it. The rest is on the page!

Thank you, Alex Spataru whoever you are! 

Hope this helps some of you who love Linux but just couldn't figure out a way to fix this. Cheers!

Everything worked out of the box, no configuration: 1080p display, wifi, sound, camera, FN keys mapped, not a single issue. It's a really thin and light laptop, has decent battery, and pretty crappy speakers (but headphone sounds great).

Definitely recommend this for any Linux n00bs looking for a good laptop at a cheap price. If you have any questions about it, feel free to ask.

**EDIT 01**

Forgot to mention that ""Linux"" in this case is Ubuntu 19.10. I haven't tried with any other distros, since this is my actual daily-driver laptop that I'm using. If Walmart wants to send me another laptop to try out, I'd be happy to put it through its paces with some of the other n00b-friendly distros. ;)

**EDIT 02**

Since this thread seems to be popular, you can find a lot more technical specs about the laptop hardware, what upgrade options are possible etc. from [this Slickdeals thread](https://slickdeals.net/f/13798283-motile-14-laptop-ryzen-5-full-hd-256-gb-hd-8gb-ram-299?v=1), which is where I found it originally. Also set up a [sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/motilelinux/), in case anyone wants to dig in deeper on it, share other (non-Ubuntu) experience, etc.","Nice!  I'm a big fan of carrying a ""beater"" laptop at around this price point with me. For my part, I like to recommend old Thinkpads, 2-4 years old. You can get them for $2-300 and they tend to be exceptionally well supported because of their popularity  within the Linux community. The Thinkpad T450S is my current backpack machine. It has 2 seperate batteries and a great keyboard. Runs Kubuntu and/or Manjaro, whichever I feel like this week, with 100% support out of the box.

Problem is, they don't game, even a tiny bit. I can play Stardew Valley but that's about all I've had much luck with. This laptop you've linked would be a much better choice if people want to play CSGO or whatever on the go."
"How can I still use the command line while something is downloading, instead of having to watch the progress of the download?","So for instance, if I'm downloading a video with youtube-dl, then it has the progress of the download in the terminal, and I'm not able to do anything else. I tried hitting Ctrl+Z, which paused the download, I then hit ""bg"" which is supposed to put it in the background, but it went right back to the way it already was. I know that I could simply open another terminal window, but I'd still like to know how to download something and not have to forcibly deal with having to watch the progress. Also, I know that certain programs have their own specific command to hide the progress, but I was hoping for something universal that I could commit to memory. Thanks for any help guys.

Also, would anyone mind explaining why trying to put it in the background by pausing it and then hitting bg didn't work? I've used those two commands to put things in the background several times before, so I'm kind of confused on what went wrong here.","Add a ""&"" at the end to make it a process on its own."
Just installed windows after over 10 years of not using it,"I hate it. I need it for a few programs that I will be using to get a cert from community college, but that is all I will use it for. I don't see how people can use windows on a daily basis. 

My computer illiterate (so she thinks) wife even uses linux and I have been teaching my 8 year simple commands in a terminal. She loves ""sudo' thanks to Simone Giertz ""sudo make me a sandwich"".

I don't know what point I am actually making here other than, if you are thinking about switching to Linux just go for it. I promise that you won't regret it.","I know this is a Linux thread, but really...you don’t know how people do it? 

Simple, when they want to install a program (package) they want to download it, double click and install. Not extract it, try to install, oops...

missing dependencies a and b.

Ok...I’ll just download them. Sure..

Package not found. 

Ok, google, where do I find this package?

Repository abcdefg

Ok, click. Wait it’s not working? I can’t click the link and go to it? It’s not a link?? 

Google: how to add a repository in Linux

Ok...uh..let’s try this add command..done! 

And install!

Package not found??

Google: package not found after adding repository 

Apt-get update

And double click to install! 

Missing dependency c. 

Wtf?! Back to google. Installed dependency c.

Missing dependency f. 

Ok...oh wait, f relies on k,m,n,q, and r. Fuuuuuck.

See the issue? Think of all the times your wanted to punch a hole into your monitor because of stupid little “hurdles” associated with learning Linux. The average end user doesn’t want that. We have an unhealthy desire to know things and torture ourselves to figure it out. Windows users just double click and it works.

Thankfully we have package managers that make things so much easier. double click a file to automatically install it...oh, wait..that sounds like some windows crap."
Block porn websites and show picture of angry dad instead,"The laptops of my children have linux, and I was wondering if it's posible to show a picture of me being angry when entring those sites. I'm planning to block them all using the list from  someonewhocares.org/hosts/.

Step-by-step guide to mastering Linux?,"So there's [this](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/books.html), which I use to guide my self-teaching math & physics. I'm looking for something similar for getting into Linux - assuming I have no previous experience, with categories broken down, explained, and provided in a simple progression. I've tried the ""just go messing around"" approach and never managed to really get into it - I'm only interested in things once I have a decent understanding of them, otherwise I'm just humiliated by my lack of ability.

So if there are any resources out there, or you have your own recommended progression (doesn't have to be fancy, just a ""learn this aspect first, here's one or two books for it, then go to this aspect, and so on and so forth""), please let me know. Thanks!","Set it up as your daily driver, and learn things you don't know.

"Are Terminal commands the same for all Linux distros? If not, what makes them differ?","Well, this question is as noob as it gets. I recently switched to Ubuntu from Windows and I started learning the command line in Terminal, just the basic stuff - how to change directories, how to setup git, how to install, remove etc. However, I don't like Ubuntu mainly because of snaps and I want to change distro to something different. I plan to check out all the major players - Fedora, Debian, Arch etc. I fear the knowledge I gained so far will go down the drain and I'll have to start again. An example of what I mean:

- Ubuntu/Debian use sudo apt update;
- Manjaro/Arch  use sudo pacman;
- CentOS uses sudo yum update;

Can someone explain this to me in as ELI5 way as possible?","The knowledge you’ve gained so far will still be relevant across the different distros(the basic stuff, changing directories and such)… the commands you’ve listed here are package managers that are specific to those distros."
I finally made a complete switch,I have been switching distros for about 1½ weeks while dual booting and I have decided to quit windows all together and go with Ubuntu. I really enjoy so far and I'm not looking back!,"Been running mint for a couple weeks, haven’t felt the need to go back to windows at all."
Virtual Audio Cable for Linux.,"After many painful days of searching for it by going through many forms and trying out stuff. I have finally found it.

`pacmd load-module module-null-sink sink_name=Virtual_Sink sink_properties=device.description=Virtual_Sink`

`pactl load-module module-remap-source master=Virtual_Sink.monitor source_name=virt_mic source_properties=device.description=VirtualMic`

These are the two commands that does it all. No need of that JaCk ThInG or ALSA loopback or some ffmpeg hack way to accomplish this simple task. Just a simple virtual speaker that pipes the audio to a virtual microphone. Just like virtual audio cable. Detected by all applications.

You are welcome.

Edit:

So I was making a soundboard for voip applications.

This is what I did....

`pacmd load-module module-null-sink sink_name=Main_Sink sink_properties=device.description=Main_Sink`

`pacmd load-module module-null-sink sink_name=LoopBack_Sink sink_properties=device.description=LoopBack_Sink`

`pactl load-module module-remap-source master=LoopBack_Sink.monitor source_name=virt_mic source_properties=device.description=LoopBack_Mic`

`pactl load-module module-remap-source master=Main_Sink.monitor source_name=virt_mic source_properties=device.description=Main_Mic`

`pactl load-module module-loopback latency_msec=1 source=<AUDIO_DEVICE_INPUT> sink=Main_Sink`

If you dont want your mic on the Main\_Mic remove this \^ line above.

`pactl load-module module-loopback latency_msec=1 source=LoopBack_Sink.monitor sink=Main_Sink`

`pactl load-module module-loopback latency_msec=1 source=LoopBack_Sink.monitor sink=<AUDIO_DEVICE_OUTPUT>`

\^ the line above is so that I can also hear the effects of the soundboard.","For your two mics into one mic thing, you could use module-loopback to have them both go to the same null-sink. I do something similar to place my system audio and microphone into the same device, except I use two loopback devices to avoid hearing myself.
