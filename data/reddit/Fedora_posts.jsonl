{"id": "1kx2qwd", "instruction": "Games run significantly worse on Fedora vs Windows 10", "input": "I'm running Fedora 42 KDE version. I have an Nvidia card (4070 super) and installed the drivers following a guide by youtuber SkyeVR. Games run but run significantly worse. modinfo -F nvidia says 570.153.02. I made sure the energy settings are on power over balanced. Everything is updated as far as I'm aware.\n\nExamples: Elden ring runs at about 45-50 FPS compared to a solid 60 on windows with the same settings. FFXIV I get anywhere from 30-40 frames less than on windows in any given situation. WIndows it's usually over 100, sometimes capped at 144, only dipping below 100 in populated areas. On Fedora, it rarely even hits 100.\n\nMy computer is not MAINLY for gaming, though I do it often, so I was hoping for a more general OS as opposed to a gaming focused one. Supposedly this is just fine for gaming, so I don't know what my issue is. \n\nGoogling I find posts saying Wayland doesn't play well with Nvidia, and to switch to Xorg, but also that Xorg is no longer in Fedora. With other people saying Wayland is perfectly fine now.\n\nI kept hearing gaming using Nvidia is still fine, is that wrong or are there other things I should check? I'm also not sure what other info I should provide.\n\nEdit: Thanks for everyone's advice and info. I can't torubleshoot further for now, but I will continue messing around and see what I can do. If I intend to give up, I'll try a gaming distro and see if that runs better. If anyone has further suggestions, I'm happy to hear them and I'll try them as I get time.\n\nedit 2: I decided to try bazzite just to see how performance was, and I was running into basically the same issues. I don't think it's a distro problem. I have decided to wipe my fedora boot and just partition it for windows sadly. I already needed to keep windows around due to old music hardware and some other programs that just don't play nice on linux at the moment. If I end up using it for games too, then that doesn't leave a lot for me to do in the linux install. Or at least, not enough to justify keeping it on one of my main drives.\n\nNext time i build a PC I intend to go with AMD and specifically build it around running Linux on it. In the mean time, I have a fedora install on a USB drive that I've been screwing around with, so I can continue screwing around with it as I wish. And I think I'll try running some other distros that I haven't checked out yet in a virtual Machine just to see what they're all like, and maybe start learning some of the more advanced ones. Thank you all again for the advice. Sadly this didn't work out for me, and not even for any fault of the OS or Distro itself. In fact I genuinely loved it otherwise.", "output": "From the sounds of it, I might just be giving up on linux for now. Maybe on a different PC build in the future."}
