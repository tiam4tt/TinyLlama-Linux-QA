The way you break Arch 99% of the time is because you didn't properly maintain your system.\n\n- Never do 'blind' updates of your system. Every time updates become available, I first check which packages can be updated (`checkupdates`), then go to the recent [Arch news](https://www.archlinux.org/news/) posts to see if any of the updates need manual intervention. \n\n- Don't do [partial updates](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_maintenance#Partial_upgrades_are_unsupported).\n\n- Don't install random packages off Github/AUR/Internet if you're not 100% certain they do what they say they do.\n\n- Don't just copy and paste commands you don't understand in to the terminal.\n\n- Keep regular backups.\n\n- Have an LTS kernel installed alongside the upstream kernel so you can drop in to that should anything weird happen on an update.\n\n- Always read and use the [official documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Main_page).\n\n- Make sure you have the correct drivers installed for your hardware."}
