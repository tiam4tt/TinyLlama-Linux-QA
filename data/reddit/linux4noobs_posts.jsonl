There's something that bothers me, something that doesn't add up.  PewDiePie does a bunch of things, on Arch, that many old timers would have trouble reproducing.  Sure, given time and a bit of effort, all of those things are possible, but quite a few of the things he did in the video are NOT beginner things, and certainly not just 5 minutes of googling.  The thing that doesn't add up is him calling himself \"not a technical guy\" and then going ahead with a notoriously hard distro and doing a bunch of things that are arguably things that takes effort.\n\nLastly, I do fear that he did the Linux community a disfavor by basically promoting Arch linux, despite his disclaimers and explanation that it is a difficult to use distro, to non-technical people.....

A Guide.", "input": "**Any actions taken as part of this guide are solely at your own risk - unfortunately there is no way to account for every hardware configuration or error that may potentially crop up. BACK UP YOUR CRITICAL DATA BEFORE DOING ANYTHING**\n\nOn the 14th Jan 2020, official Windows 7 support ends for most users. This means if you run Windows 7 beyond that date, you're no longer going to receive security and system updates, which will leave you increasingly vulnerable to viruses, malware and system failure. Depending on how critical your data is and how often you back up - if at all - there's a potential you can lose everything.\n\nThis is a somewhat opinionated but no-bullshit guide for those of you still on Windows 7 who really don't want or won't move to Windows 10. Aside from my own additions, it's going to reference a lot of great guides and advice written by other people, but conveniently collected in a single place. It's crazy, but it might just work. \n\nHave you considered... Linux? Specifically, Ubuntu.\n\nNo, hear me out. Because I'm going to start (and save you a lot of time) by telling you why you SHOULDN'T switch to Linux. If any of the criteria listed apply, then:\n  \n* [Switch to Windows 10 while you can still get a \"free upgrade\" using your Windows 7 key](https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-free-windows-10-upgrade/). You can even use it as an excuse to justify that machine upgrade you've been wanting the past couple of years!\n* Keep your Windows 7 machine and disconnect it from the Internet and all networks forever unless you want to get owned and lose everything dear to you in the next couple of months or so.\n* Buy a Mac. \n\nThe guide is broken into the following sections, if you want to jump to the points that are relevant. If you want to get straight to it, go to (4):\n\n1. Why shouldn't I go with Linux?\n2. Why should I go with Linux?\n3. Why Ubuntu?\n4. What's involved in switching?\n5. Installation of Ubuntu\n6. Tips for new users using Ubuntu\n7. Gaming on Linux\n8. Alternative Software\n9. TL;DR or The Conclusion\n10. To do list for the guide\n\n# 1. Why shouldn't I go with Linux?\n------------------\nIf you:\n\n* Don't feel comfortable installing an operating system and you don't have someone that can do it for you;\n* Have someone that helps you with all your IT-related activities who is not familiar with or dislikes Linux (ask them);\n* Are big into multiplayer games. (There are exceptions here, discussed in more detail in the Linux Gaming section);\n* Use multiple game clients and have a lot of games on platforms other than Steam;\n* Are into any sort of VR;\n* Absolutely need Outlook and refuse to consider any other mail client, like Thunderbird;\n* Use a VPN provider that doesn't have a Linux version and aren't willing/able to change;\n* Are subscribed to multiple video streaming services other than Netflix and watch these on your PC frequently;\n* Use Photoshop, Premiere, 3D Studio Max - actually, if you have any Windows software that you are locked into due to muscle memory, experience and/or professional requirements and that have no Linux version. (There are, however, often a Linux *alternatives* for a lot of these);\n* Require assistive technologies, such as screenreaders. While [Ubuntu comes with several built-in assistive tools](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Accessibility), there's a lot of specialised assistive use cases, tools and hardware that don't work on Linux and have no comparable alternative;\n* Want to be able to buy whatever piece of hardware that takes your fancy without researching it and expect them to work out the box with zero hassle. Especially niche and specific hardware like flight controllers, sound boards and so on;\n* Use iTunes extensively for your media library and/or interacting with your iPhone;\n* Have a large archive of Microsoft Office documents that use complex formatting, macros and/or formulas that you refer back to frequently.\n* **have the worst-case scenario: rely on legacy or ancient software or hardware you're not sure you have the installation media for anymore, can't find a replacement, can't download it and it doesn't work on Windows 10. In this case, you're going to have to keep that Windows 7 box around and it's even more imperative that you make sure it's not accessible from the web or network. Start looking at moving to a more modern equivalent of it AND converting your work to a format that'll be accessible.** \n\nSome of this stuff you can work around with some effort, but it's more likely going to be more trouble than you're willing to put up with. And that's fine; Linux can't help everyone. The more of these that apply, the more certain you can be that you shouldn't consider Linux and should just go with Windows 10, unless you're willing to ~sacrifice~ compromise.\n\n# 2. Why should I go with Linux?\n------------\n\nBecause whether you're a general user, a gamer or a specialised user with niche interests or requirements, Linux can provide you the same experience you're getting now with some already stated exceptions. In many ways, it's better - it's free, it's generally runs better on older hardware than Windows, it's relatively more secure due to a small user footprint and you'll have a huge, vetted library of free software that you can access. There are some applications - older Windows software and games, for instance - that don't work on Windows 10 but do on Linux, thanks to projects like Wine and Proton. It can 99% of the time update itself without interrupting whatever you're doing.\n\nThat being said, it's not perfect. You will lose some things. You will need to learn new ways of working with your PC. This is inevitable. That's the cost of switching.\n\nWhich is not to say Windows is without a cost. Unlike Windows, none of this functionality comes at the cost of your privacy and freedom. Linux will let you configure it as you like, and dive into the nitty-gritty settings to fine-tune it further. It will [not try and trick you into creating yet another online account to use it](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-hides-windows-10-offline-account,40506.html). Aside from a few missteps ([Ubuntu and Amazon](https://www.howtogeek.com/126995/how-to-disable-the-amazon-search-ads-in-ubuntus-unity-dash/), for one), it keeps its nose out of your business. It does not come with a [unique advertising ID](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4459081/windows-10-general-privacy-settings) that links your multitude of online and offline interests and programs into a nice, tidy, profitable pack of data to be shared with \"trusted third-parties\". It does not serve you ads in a product you paid for. It does not try and push you into multiple online services. \n\nIn short, it does not suffer from any of the privacy concerns of Windows' future.\n\nNow, I know people are going to throw snark about lead-and-tin alloys, their pliability and how easy that makes it to fashion headgear, but please note I said \"future\"; while they're not necessarily prying now, your operating system - and for almost everyone, that means Microsoft - has a very privileged position in your life as far as personal data is concerned. Any time you search in the file manager, every word you write and document you save, your budget calculations, every photo you view and program you use, every voice command you give Cortana, Windows - and by extension Microsoft - knows about. And there's nothing in their Terms of Service that *stop* them from starting to collect more detailed data if they so choose.\n\nIt's not a question of whether you prefer Windows 7 over 10 - Windows 7 got the same telemetry features as Windows 10 ages ago. Rather, ask yourself if you're happy with Microsoft's evolving business model, one that is shifting more and more of your content online and is intricately and opaquely tied to your personal data? If you're not, you're not alone: [Holland isn't happy](https://www.bit-tech.net/news/tech/software/dutch-dpa-opens-privacy-investigation-into-windows-10/1/). [Germany's not too thrilled either](https://thenextweb.com/privacy/2019/07/15/german-schools-ban-microsoft-office-365-amid-privacy-concerns/). There are legitimate reasons to be wary of Window's market dominance and increased level of embedded user analytics. Linux offers you an alternative.\n\n# 3. Why Ubuntu?\n-------------\nUbuntu LTS is by far the most commonly used desktop Linux distro and the one with the widest support by software developers and hardware manufacturers involved in Linux. If you're searching for solutions, you'll mostly find Ubuntu ones. Lastly, Ubuntu's LTS versions are supported for long periods of time: 18.04, which we'll be recommending, is supported until 2023, while the next version coming out in April, Ubuntu 20.04, will be supported until 2025.\n\nOne of the things you'll quickly learn about the Linux community is that someone will ALWAYS suggest a different Linux distro. In this case, it'll probably be [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/), which aims to be a newbie-friendly Linux. It's based on Ubuntu, is similar to Windows 7 and will MOSTLY work the same as Ubuntu. I still suggest Ubuntu, but whatever, follow your heart.\n\nTo keep this guide as approachable as possible, and to have access to the widest range of help and support, I decided to focus on Ubuntu. Anything other than these two and you're just making things harder for yourself as a new user. You can always switch once you get a feel for how things work.\n\n# 4. What's involved in switching?\n------------------\n\nI promised you a no-bullshit guide, so I'm going to cut straight to it. Take your time with all of these steps, do them properly, and you shouldn't have a problem.\n\nFirst step: back up all your important documents, photos, email, games - whatever is important to you, and preferably somewhere external to your machine. This is just good advice regardless of whether you're switching to Linux or not. *Always have a backup.*\n\nIf you're a gamer, check out the [following guide by PC Gamer's Jarred Walton on how to back up your games across multiple clients.] (https://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-transfer-game-files-between-pcs/)\n\nWhile you're backing up, [install Thunderbird (Mozilla's open-source mail client)](https://www.thunderbird.net/) and copy your mail over to it. You'll have a much easier time doing this in Windows than in Linux to start. Thunderbird can automatically pull your mail from Outlook if installed on the same machine. Then [follow the steps here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data) for backing up your Thunderbird profile. You'll restore this in Linux later. Make sure you have your mail account details. \n\nGet hold of your Windows 7 serial key. If it's physical media, like a DVD, then check and make sure the key is in the box or on the disc. If it's a laptop that came with Windows 7 preinstalled, it's usually a sticker on the specific laptop. You'll need this if things go awry and/or decide Linux is not for you.\n\nCheck [the minimum specs for Ubuntu 18.04.03 here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop). If your system doesn't meet them, you're going to have a bad time regardless of whether you go with Ubuntu or Windows 10 ([Windows 10 minimum requirements](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028142/windows-10-system-requirements) are bullshit, btw. 1Gb Ram, 1Ghz processor? I challenge anyone to link me to a Windows 10 video running on those specs where it performs acceptably.). There are lightweight alternatives if you can't afford a new PC, (Lubuntu, for instance), but upgrading your PC should be your first step in this case.\n\nHere comes the arduous bit. Make a list of your current hardware, software and services that you use frequently, make sure you have the installation media for the critical pieces of software you use (Don't expect to be able to just copy/paste the applications you have) and do a search on whether they run on Linux. I'd recommend following the \"Software\" section in this guide on [Migrating to Linux](https://old.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/edaq0s/guide_migrating_to_linux_in_2020/) by /u/PBLKGodofGrunts]\n\nA lot of the Linux software alternatives, such as LibreOffice and GIMP, are available for Windows as well. Consider downloading those that interest you to try out in Windows and get a feel for how they work. \n\nUltimately, to echo the advice you'll find that you can either run it, have an alternative or just can't switch. That's okay; Linux can't help everyone.\n\nDownload [the Ubuntu LTS 18.04.03 distro](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop). The \"LTS\" means it's a long-term support version - you won't have to think about this exercise for the next three years if you're lucky. Ubuntu LTS 20.04 is coming out in four months, which'll be supported until 2025, but since most of the focus is still on 18.04, you're better off sticking with it for now.\n\nWhichever you choose, you'll have to write it to a DVD or USB. If it's a DVD, use whatever you normally use to write DVD ISOs. If you're going to use a USB, [here's a guide to doing that.](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#0)\n\nDid I mention to back-up your important data? Back-up your important data. Double-check that it's all there. If you want to take an extra precaution, you [can use Clonezilla to clone your current OS drive](https://www.clonezilla.org/). It's not necessary, but if things go bust, Clonezilla allows you to restore your PC to precisely the way it was before you started without needing to install Windows from scratch. However, Clonezilla can be a bit daunting if you're not technically inclined. Check out this [somewhat out-of-date video by cButters Tech for a general idea of what's involved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JflYnwe8cTE).\n\nLastly, try running Ubuntu as a Live CD/USB first. This will allow you to run Ubuntu as if it were installed, but without making any changes to your current installation. Please keep in mind that the Live is not indicative of performance... it will run slower than if it was installed, as it has to read everything off the DVD or USB stick first and load it memory. The important thing to check here is that it's picking up all your hardware, that it's displaying on your screen correctly, that all your drives are available, and so on.\n\nLive USB should perform better than a Live DVD. Check out the \"Okay, it's installed/Okay, I'm running the Live CD. What tips do you have for using Ubuntu?\" section to get an idea of what you should be checking.\n\n# 5. Installation.\n-----------------\n\nYou've done all the above, triple-checked your backups and either decided that you can't make the jump or you're ready. \n\nHowever, before you begin installing, you have one last decision to make.\n\nThere's a lot people that suggest dual-booting - that's where you keep Windows around and just install Linux alongside it. This is often proposed as a safety net and a means for people to have the best of both worlds. I don't, for a couple of reasons:\n\n* If you are going to dual-boot, you'll need to update to Windows 10 anyway, and if you're going to do that, why bother with Linux in the first place?\n\n* Data will be spread between two operating systems. Instead of backing up and maintaining one OS, you'll be maintaining two. It's doable but a PITA.\n\n* You're sabotaging your efforts, and your switch to Linux will likely fail. That's not a statement on Linux's capability or ease of use. A lot of things are easier on Linux - but they won't be at first. You probably have years of Windows use ingrained in you; you've come to expect things to work they way Windows works. That's not ease, that's familiarity; that's a boiling frog. And the moment something throws you a challenge in Linux, the temptation to just \"do it\" in Windows will be too great. And the more you do that, the more running Linux will seem like a chore than a choice.\n\n* If you absolutely have no option but to run Windows 10, do it in a virtual machine - you get the benefits of dual-booting but with the bonus of limiting Windows 10 to a virtual environment where access to the rest of your system (and personal data) is restricted while allowing you to run your non-negotiable applications (other than games or any intense 3D applications) just fine.\n\nIf you decide to dual-boot, you'll need to find a recent guide that covers this. Typically, it's best to update to Windows 10 first, then follow the guide to dual-boot Ubuntu. None of the guides I found seemed good for beginners, so I'm willing to take suggestions from the comments.\n\nIf you take my advice and simply dive in, installing Ubuntu on your machine will be a painless process: [just follow the steps here in a beginner's guide written by Jason Evangelho and you should be fine.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/08/29/beginners-guide-how-to-install-ubuntu-linux/)\n\n# 6. Tips for new users using Ubuntu?\n------------------\n\nThings that you should do only once Ubuntu's installed are prefixed with an [+]. Otherwise, the tip applies to both installs and Live demos:\n\n* Power off, log-out and running taskbar applications will be in the top-right of the screen by default.\n* To search, press the Windows key on your keyboard. This'll bring up Ubuntu's search bar. You can use this to find applications, folders and system settings.\n* In the File Manager, your Home directory will be where your primary OS and applications will typically be installed, while the Other Locations will list additional hard drives (usually your additional storage drives). By default, Ubuntu does not actually mount the drives in the \"Other Locations\" section. Clicking on any of them, however, will automatically mount them. If you want to learn more about the general structure of Ubuntu's file system, [you can do so here](http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/the-linux-file-system-structure-explained).\n* Ctrl+Alt+T will bring up the terminal. The terminal is where you'll often be sent if you're attempting to diagnose a problem, perform specific tasks or install specific tools/software. Check yourself before your wreck yourself before copy-pasting commands from strangers on the 'net. Be super cautious of any command that involves \"sudo\" and \"rm\".\n* The default office suite for Ubuntu is LibreOffice. Try it out: see if you can open a couple of your documents, like spreadsheets and Word docs. You might be pleasantly surprised. Writer is the word processor, Calc is for Spreadsheets. Formating on complex documents will likely be broken. Don't save any of these at this point. \n* In fact, open up a couple of common files you normally use - images, documents, compressed files, music, videos and so on. Get a feel for how it works, what opens and what doesn't. Sometimes, you'll need to install some software first before it will work.\n* Check the list of alternative software for some suggestions on what to install if you seem to be missing something.\n* Plug in your phone and see if it detects it and you can access your files. If it's Android, you should be fine.\n* You'll notice that some commands - like updating - require you to enter your password again. This is a security feature similar to when Windows ask you to run a program as administrator or with elevated privileges. If you didn't initiate the command that brought up the password request, be cautious about entering it in.\n* [+] Change your desktop preferences and move the application bar to the bottom of the screen. By default, Ubuntu puts it on the left-side. Hey, maybe you'll like it like that! This was the one Windows habit I was never able to shake.\n* [+] Try and store your data in the pre-defined folders (Music, Videos, Documents, Pictures). You don't have to, but you'll make your life a lot easier doing so.\n* [+] Search for and create a shortcut to the Software Updater. This allows you to quickly check for and install Ubuntu updates.\n* [+] Likewise, create a shortcut to the Ubuntu Software Centre. To start with, you'll want to stick to installing applications from the Centre. These have been specifically tested to work on Ubuntu and will 99% run without a hitch. You'll be able to remove applications from here as well.\n* [+] Speaking of the Centre, Ubuntu comes preinstalled with an Amazon launcher. Use this time search for it and remove it. Or don't, it's up to you.\n* [+] Sometimes, you'll see there's two versions of a piece of software in the Centre. This is most likely due to there being a Snap version of it. Snaps are self-contained versions of the software that are usually the most up-to-date; however, they can run erratically or not have access to some things on your system, like fonts. I'd stick with the ubuntu-bionic versions for best compatibility.\n* [+] If you're a gamer, change your graphic drivers so you can get reasonable performance. For Nvidia, simply search for the Software & Updates application, open it, select the Additional Drivers Tab, and [check whether you're using the Nvidia Driver](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/07/install-nvidia-driver-update-ubuntu-its). You'll want to select the one that's listed as proprietary and tested. AMD's a little more complicated and I profess to having little experience with it. I'll happily take advice from the comments in this instance.\n* [+] When downloading some games or applications specifically for Linux, you'll often get a .Deb file or a script. A deb file can often be run as is by double-clicking in Ubuntu; you can read more about them [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_%28file_format%29). Scripts often need to be run from the terminal and made to be executable. [You read more about that here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/38661/how-do-i-run-sh-scripts). Again, same safety check applies to running anything you download from the web.\n\n# 7. Gaming on Linux\n--------------\n\nIf you're a gamer, I'd recommend [the following the guide by /u/PBLKGodofGrunts](https://old.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/edaq0s/guide_migrating_to_linux_in_2020/) on the /r/linux_gaming subbreddit. But to summarise...\n\n##The Good News\nThanks to Valve's involvement in Linux through Proton and the efforts of the Wine team, Linux gaming has never been better. It's now possible to play many Windows-only games with no hassle and minimal performance loss. Just a few examples of recent games that run just fine on Linux are the Resident Evil 2 remake, Sekiro, Halo: Master Chief Collection (single-player and custom multiplayer games), DOOM, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Risk of Rain 2, Total War: Three Kingdoms, and more; you can even toss a coin to all of your Witchers. To get an idea of games that run on Linux, you can visit [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com), [Wine AppDB](https://appdb.winehq.org/) or [Lutris](https://www.lutris.net) and search for your desired game. If you're primarily a single-player gamer, the transition should be mostly painless.\n\nAnother amazing development is the number of open-source implementations of older games game engines that allow for playing of classic and retro titles on modern hardware, (such as [DevilutionX for Diablo 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/ei7h2p/devilutionx_an_opensource_diablo_1_replacement/))often with improvements, bug fixes and quality of life improvements, ensuring they'll be able to run into the future. \n\nHowever, the most critical development is that the number of developers and platforms that provide and support native Linux games has increased significantly. [Feral Interactive](https://www.feralinteractive.com/en/) publishes several AAA Linux ports, numerous indies now provide a Linux version, and store fronts like [GOG](https://www.gog.com/) and [itch.io](https://itch.io/) provide an alternative with DRM-free games. \n\n##The Bad News\n\nDespite all of this, gaming remains one of the biggest hurdles to adopting Linux.\n\nIf you're into multiplayer gaming, you're out of luck. While many multiplayer titles do work on Linux (LoL, Dota 2, CS:GO, TF2, Rocket League, Warframe, Overwatch, Starcraft II, World of Warcraft, Eve Online, Elite: Dangerous, Monster Hunter:World and so on), many more don't - Fortnite, some Call of Duties, Apex Legends, PUBG, Battlefield, GTA Online. Essentially, anything with an anti-cheat is likely NOT going to work, and there's always the risk that playing a Windows multiplayer game will get you banned due to anti-cheat measures that dislike any whiff of Linux. My suggestion is check which games you play and go from there.\n \nUnless you're using Steam, running other launchers is complicated and prone to constant breakage without continuous effort and maintenance. Epic, Origin, Uplay and GOG Galaxy can all run on Linux with some effort. Lutris does sort most of these out, but you'll need to follow the [instructions here](https://lutris.net/downloads/), which means your going to have to [install Wine first](https://wiki.winehq.org/Ubuntu).\n\nSome games simply don't work, and there's no solution for it. \n\nSome of the latest developments aren't going to be available to you. VR is tiny on Linux, and you'll likely lose access to most of your VR software and experiences.\n\nDespite being fairly technical already, many gamers do expect things to \"just work\". Here's a list of things that require some effort to get working correctly:\n\n* Super-sampling is out. Not entirely, but it's more complicated than Windows.\n* Access to things like custom shaders and injectors are also going to be limited. Mods can be more complicated or, in some cases, not available.\n* You'll lose some of the benefits of your Gsync/Freesync monitors, since the two tech don't work that well on Ubuntu's standard display compositor. This will change once Ubuntu shifts to Wayland. \n* Things like community game patches are often aimed at Windows, with no Linux alternative.\n\nMost importantly, AMD and Nvidia graphic cards are handled very differently on Linux when compared to Windows. Ubuntu uses an open-source driver by default - this is alright for general use but terrible for games and 3D applications. To get decent performance, you'll need to install their respective drivers.\n\nNvidia's latest Linux drivers are made available in Ubuntu directly. However, this is just the drivers: Nvidia's GeForce Experience isn't available on Linux and you're going to lose access to all of its tools. That means no Ansel in many cases, no DSR, no predefined gaming configs and no ShadowPlay (Although OBS offers a decent alternative in this case). See the Tips section above on how to install it. On the plus side, the installation process is a breeze and Nvidia's performance is fairly solid.\n\nAMD benefits from much better open-source drivers and active support from AMD, but unfortunately suffers from delays for support of their most recent cards and a fairly complicated install process . AMD uses the MESA Driver, combined with Valve's ACO shader compiler, to deliver performance boosts. Installing these drivers can be a complicated, multi-step process. I'm sorry I can't help you on this; I'll happily take someone's advice on getting this working in Ubuntu LTS and include it in the guide.\n\n# 8. Alternative software\n---------------\n\nThis is a quick and dirty guide to equivalent software for Windows applications in Linux. \n\n* Antivirus software: This may seem counterintuitive, but for the most part Linux does not require any sort of anti-virus software. While viruses for Linux exist, the number of viruses and such that target the Linux desktop specifically is tiny compared to Windows. [You can read up about it here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_malware). That being said, if you are concerned there are several tools available for detecting both Windows and Linux malware on the same page. Follow good internet hygiene, don't open suspicious links/mails and think before just randomly following command instructions on the 'net.\n* Microsoft Office: [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/). Or you can access Office365 online. \n* Adobe Photoshop: [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), [Krita](https://krita.org/)\n* Adobe Premiere: [Blender](https://www.blender.org)\n* 3D Studio Max: Blender\n* Illustrator/CorelDraw: [Inkscape](https://www.inkscape.org)\n* Xsplit: [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)\n* Windows Media Player: [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)\n* Basic Audio Editor: [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)\n* Audio Mixing: [Ardour](https://ardour.org/), [Mixbus](https://harrisonconsoles.com/site/mixbus.html)\n* Adobe Reader: While there are several PDF readers on Linux you can use, almost none of them play well with Adobe PDFs with advanced features. You're better off sticking with what comes with Ubuntu, and if it doesn't work, open it up in a browser.\n\n# 9. TL;DR or The Conclusion\n------------\n\nSwitching to Ubuntu is possible and relatively safe if you do some research on which apps/games/software/hardware you use will and won't work on Linux first, you BACK UP YOUR IMPORTANT DATA before doing anything and don't expect a 1:1 experience with Windows. It's all dependent on your flexibility, technical experience and willingness to learn and compromise.\n\nIf you're not, Windows 10 is a perfectly acceptable choice to upgrade to: you'll benefit from improved security compared to Windows 7, a larger selection of hardware and software and will have to put less effort to make everything work at the cost of your privacy and some ads.\n\nIf you have legacy software or unsupported hardware that doesn't run on either, you're kind of screwed. I'd keep the Windows 7 box around, make sure it's disconnected from all networks (for your sake as well as others) and start making emergency contingency plans to find a modern alternative.\n\nI know that people are going to take issue with some of the difficulties I raised, and suggest they're really not dealbreakers.

Good!!\n\n2 great distros you can begin with, are:\n\n1. Linux Mint\n2. Fedora\n\nThese two are great beginning points, and they offer things fairly easily to the user. They both have App Stores (similar to the Microsoft Store, except much better). Fedora offers a bit more up to date packages than Mint, but Mint is also great because of its simplicity and ease of use.\n\n(This is purely based off of general opinion and view, its what a lot of the community uses, and is a great starting point for Linux.)\n\n**VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND:**\n\nNot all games work. About 90% of them do, but anticheat oriented games (usually, some of them do work) dont work. Games like Valorant, Fortnite, LOL, Apex Legends for example dont run on Linux due to them being very Anti-Linux and they refuse to accept Linux users. Most games however, should work just fine at this point.\n\nKeep an open mind! Linux is a learning experience, finding new apps, learning the terminal, if something doesnt work, **dont be afraid to ask others!!**\nIt's how we as a community grow.\nAnd most of all, have fun.

Or was every single element likely designed and then scripted by himself?)\n- The fading transitions on Arch (technically UI too, I guess)\n\nHe showed off stuff he was excited about (which I totally get) but I did think it was a big shame that the video didn't provide much context on how easy/insane the things he did were", "output": "They are all very easy if you have some experience and put some time in to learning. None of it is S Tier level difficult. What PewDiePie demonstrated though is that he was willing to put in the time and effort to find out how to fix these issue and customize his system, he also showed a genuine excitement for the freedom that Linux gives you. I have nothing but good things to say about what he demonstrated. \n\nHe used  systemd-analyze blame if I remember correctly. This will tell you the time services took to start on bootup. However whilst you can disable them all that wouldn't be a good idea, so he would have had to work out which ones to disable or pause etc\n\nWith Firefox he probably enabled hardware acceleration, he may also have had too many extensions running and weeded out the ones that he didn't need. He may have simply cleared the cache or setup preload\n\nHe used Neofetch in his terminal however this is the only part where I can remember thinking ok he doesn't know about Fastfetch and that is generally preferred now due to lack of ongoing support with Neofetch.\n\nTo fix the F keys he must have looked at the Arch Wiki, this is one of the best documentations on Linux and Arch and every experienced Linux user has probably referenced it\n\n[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Extra\\_keyboard\\_keys](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Extra_keyboard_keys)\n\nFor his ricing he was using Hyprland as the Window manager, Hyprland runs on Wayland which is the compositor. Generally you have either Wayland or X11. If you have Nvidia GPU then the preference is X11. I run X11 myself as it seems to work niceer with Nvidia. Maybe that has changed now I'll find out whenever I change to a Wayland based distro. For the widgets he may have been using Eww. The swapping of desktops is built into most Linux desktop environments. Even Windows has had this for some time now I believe.\n\nThe top bar he used Waybar and a script to minimise it depending on his workflow, he didn't say if he created the script or not, or found a script or modified an existing one. \n\nFor the search launcher he uses Rofi.\n\nNone of this is difficult stuff but it takes time to discover all this, so he did the work. Is he a competent Linux admin now? Nothing he showed demonstrates that he is BUT considering the progress he made I'm sure he could be a decent programmer and sysadmin because he was enjoying what he was doing and loved discovering how to do things and that is half the battle.\n\nI apologise if there are mistakes in the above, that is my take on it."}

Notice a pattern? Man I talk in too many condescending questions.\n\nThe only reason I mentioned Emacs over Vim is because Emacs has superior support in graphical environments, sorry Vim fanboys.

(Linux taught me a life lesson.)", "input": "Switched to Linux from Windows 3 weeks ago (CachyOS) and the first 10 days or so I was going wild with the constant reinstalling, distro-hopping and tweaking. I was feeling this weird dopamine hit from setting up a new Distro/DE and tweaking it, adding new applets, extensions and such. Watching the terminal flow as I was executing a new command feeling a weird happiness from it etc. I think it was also a way of escaping my real responsibilities for a while but that's another topic.\n\nSome time passed and I finally felt satisfied with my system. It was just working and honestly I was seriously getting stressed and tired of constant tinkering. So I decided to just leave it as it is and do what I normally do on a computer. For a while I kept waiting everyday for the rush of watching the system update in the terminal via \"sudo pacman -Syu\" I know, it's weird but it just felt good for some reason.\n\nAfter some days I decided to let that one go as well and update only once in a couple of days instead of trying the command every 2-3 hours for the dopamine.\n\nNow, the rush of \"switching to Linux\" has passed and my computer has become just a tool once again. I just turn it on, do my business and leave. Nothing special. No more tinkering, no more looking for a new flatpak or some terminal gimmick. It's just my computer.\n\nThis makes me realize Linux is not some crazy wild unthinkable dare. It's just an OS, and it's not that different. I just do whatever I used to do when I was using Windows and now my  Linux computer feels like something I'm used to, something home. If ya know what I mean. It's just like Windows but better, lighter, more user friendly, personal and open-source.\n\nHonestly viewing my computer/system this way feels much better and cozier. It truly feels mine and familiar. Not changing things constantly gradually builds up a sense of familiarity that gives a different kind of happiness and calmness when you are using your computer. It's like it's there for you, whenever you need it, just the way it is, just the way you know it to be. For you to use it, for your help. This is such a good feeling.\n\nI certainly felt the same rush of dopamine from ricing, tweaking etc. so I understand folks who are into that but I am getting old and I have other responsibilities and this way of using my computer just feels right and the way it was supposed to be used.

And if someone notices that my computer looks a bit different I just casually mention \"oh yeah I use Linux it's just a different OS\" if they are curious about it I answer but I don't go too eager to show it to them. Weirdly enough this natural behavior makes them much more interested in it in the long run.\n\nI think this has taught me something about life itself. When we get too invested in constantly getting more and better we are putting ourselves in the risk of missing out on actually appreciating something in a boring way and that is truly something special. Like a morning coffee that you just drink in a certain way every single day and the sound of the rain you like just because it is the way it is from your room. The wallpaper in your walls and the sense of familiarity it brings when you get home from a long trip. This way of appreciation of the boring things makes life richer and reliable which in turn gives way to a sense of stability and constancy allowing you to focus on growing and expanding on the foundation of things that just work on their own so that you don't have to worry about them.\n\nI know I am a bit of a philosophizer but I felt the desire to share this for a  couple of days now so excuse my rambling, hope you guys are having a good day.", "output": "Congratulations - you have arrived  :)"}

People who like the arch way, will find their way there eventually for sure. Arch people, Why do you hate linux? Why dont you want it to become more wide-spread?\n\n---\n\nArch approach is 'you either learn to swim or you die' is fucking stupid **FOR NOOBS**\n\nWhen you learn math, you first learn addition, then subtraction, then multiplication, then division, then the harder stuff\n\nYou learn to walk, then to run\n\nThats how you learn everything else. Why cant you see this is not a good way to learn linux either?\n\nI used to think linux was hard and failed to make the switch a few times. Just because i thought linux was too hard and time consuming for me... :(\n\nNow that i know a lot about linux, i think thats really not true at all. I managed to have everybody around me using ubuntu and, most difficult, to like it. (Disclaimer: i dont use ubuntu myself)\n\n95% of all distros are made of the same stuff. Starting with something hard is fucking retarded and we have here only stories of the people who survived instead of the stories of the people going back to windows because they thought linux was hard\n\nArch is survivor bias at its peak of stupidity. I swear to god that new comers that overcome the barrier reach peak stupidity and tries to infect others with their disease like they have become enlightened\n\nI like to fiddle **a lot** in linux. Its great compared with windows. But I like to do this with a few packages i care about. The rest, i just want them to work. This is true for the vast majority. Specially new people starting\n\nYou can have everything working and learn one package the same in any distro, all while having the rest of you distro working. Arch is not special in that way at all. You learn in small bits at your own pace and you are not REQUIRED to learn something\n\nYou can even use the arch wiki to learn while in other distro\n\nWhy arch is not good for new comers:\n\n * By design, they touch upstream the least amount. A good distro will remove things from upstream that are bad for the user. The user is the priority, not the developer\n * This also implies that things are not standarized either. A good distro will try to make everything homogeneous and work in a similar fashion even if they come from different sources. Again by design. It creates expectations on the users. In Arch you will have to learn upstream of every package\n * AUR is not fucking curated. Yes, malware is found there from time to time\n * New comers come from windows, not to from other linux distro. If they fail to make the switch, they come back to windows\n * They are memeing arch to make it appealing to people that dont know better. In a way, it feels they are being tricked. And i dont really like when people is taken advantage of\n\nPlease, instead of installing arch because you are memed into it, read their [principles](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux#Principles) to see if they appeal to you\n\nPS:\n\nI acknowledge that people that uses arch linux like to learn about linux and that as a whole is great, but i wont sacrifice a potential new linux user that just uses it and chill just in the off case they might enjoy more the 'swim or die' arch way\n\nI also acknowledge that this particular style is good for a few people, but not for the majority of people", "output": "People who recommend Arch to new users of Linux are either idiots that do not want to see Linux grow and purposely are trying to damage Linux's reputation as a credible alternative to OS X and Windows, presumably for some elitest reason or trolls. \n\nThe reality is that the vast majority of people who try Linux will be coming from Windows and those same people will not be technical minded. \n\nThey are used to the Windows way of thinking with GUI tools, so only now to be told that they will have to build a system from scratch will do one of two things, frustrate them and send them straight back to Windows with the same old stereotypes about Linux reaffirmed. \n\nI agree that as a community we should have preferences on our favourite distributions, but for the mindset of new user, we really should be recommending distributions with the most polish and user friendliness, for example Linux Mint or Ubuntu. \n\nArch can come later once they have a firm grasp of Linux, certainly not at the beginning. \n\nRyan"}
{"id": "3vnadm", "instruction": "An open letter to Linux noobs regarding Kali Linux.", "input": "With alarming frequency I see posts on this subreddit involving relatively basic troubleshooting questions from users running Kali Linux. I wrote this as a response to that. I think Kali Linux is great. I just don't think everybody should be using it as a desktop OS.\n\n**The TL;DR for this post could be taken straight from the [Kali FAQ](http://docs.kali.org/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux)**: \"If you are unfamiliar with Linux generally, if you do not have at least a basic level of competence in administering a system, if you are looking for a Linux distribution to use as a learning tool to get to know your way around Linux, or if you want a distro that you can use as a general purpose desktop installation, Kali Linux is probably not what you are looking for.\"\n\n*Dear Linux noobs,*\n\nLinux is cool. You're interested in Linux and that makes you cool too. You should be proud of your interest in Linux. You're now part of a community that is full of cool people (OK, a few of us are jerks, but what can you do).\n\nWhat else is cool? Computer hacking. Password cracking. Network penetration. These things are neat, and the people who can do them are usually pretty cool too (though some of them are jerks too). Learning to do these things is fun, and if you want to do it, you should. When practiced responsibly, these things can make fun hobbies, or even a lucrative career. The purpose of this post is not to discourage anybody from learning to do these things.\n\nOne of the major problems new Linux users face when starting out is figuring out which Linux distribution is right for them. There are a lot of options after all. Everybody likes to recommend their favorite distro (and also occasionally give their opinion on their least favorite distro). Very frequently I see questions in this subreddit, and in related subreddits, like \"What distro should I use?\", \"I want to learn to code, what distro would be good for me?\", \"What is the best distro for python programming?\", or \"What distro should I use to learn penetration testing?\". New Linux users who might be interested in penetration testing (or some other related topic) might, by some means or another, discover Kali Linux. They might think \"Hey, I want to learn Linux and also pen-testing! I should use Kali Linux.\" They'd probably be wrong.\n\nThe thing is, most desktop distributions provide access to the same software. If you want to watch Youtube videos and write email, Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, etc, are all equally capable of that. If you want to learn python programming, you can do that on any of those distributions. Similarly, if you want to learn pen-testing, you can do it from any of those distributions.\n\nKali Linux is a distribution specifically designed to be a toolkit for professional pen-testers. As such, it might be very attractive to new Linux users who are interested in security. However, Kali is /not/ designed as a general purpose Linux distro. Some elements of it's design are simply not suited for use as a general purpose desktop. If you're a new Linux user who installs Kali Linux chances are you will have a frustrating experience. The Kali Linux maintainers even have a FAQ page \"Is Kali Linux right for me?\" \n\nhttp://docs.kali.org/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux\n\nPlease read that article before deciding to use Kali as a desktop OS, especially if you're new to Linux. If you don't yet understand some of the points made in that article that's probably a sign to avoid Kali for now.\n\nIt's quite often that I see people asking questions like \"How do I do X in Kali Linux?\" or \"[Kali] Y is not working. Please help.\" Unfortunately these users don't usually get the help they need, which makes me sad. The posts are often dismissed or downvoted. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I'd wager that most of the people asking these questions don't need Kali. They need a desktop distribution.\n\nI am worried that if your first adventures with Linux are in Kali you will have a frustrating experience and be turned off from the whole endeavor. Your questions might be dismissed and left unanswered because you appear to be in over your head.\n\n*Using Kali Linux as your first desktop Linux distro is like learning to drive on a racecar. Please don't do it.*\n\nPeace.", "output": "Thanks for writing this...and especially for writing it pretty diplomatic. I probably would have used...far too strong language. Great work."}

I scoured the internet and eventually found that if I installed a specific driver and a specific kernel and a specific header then it would all work. Luckily I could USB tether from my phone to get that all done and it worked!\n\nI better make a backup of my system and those drivers and stuff! Pop in a flash drive and nothing happens. Off to Google to learn how to mount it in the terminal. \n\nThen I wanted it to mount my NAS automatically on boot, but I had a lot of problems with it trying and failing to do that before being connected to the network.

Start with Linux Mint or Ubuntu. After you get a feel for Linux and you want to continue, then you can experiment with specialized or alternate distros. Lot of information is going to fly at you in this thread, just some clarifying points:\n\n-Distros are commonly used interchangeably with OS in this world. You can think of them as versions of Linux that are maintained by different organizations. \n\n-The \"Desktop Environment\" is commonly what the average person would think of when they imagine an OS. This would be your user interface, system tools and default applications. The big two are KDE and Gnome. KDE looks a lot like Windows by default, Gnome resembles Mac OS a bit more. Neither will hold you back with what you want to do, so I would pick only on aesthetics and how customizable you want your setup to be (KDE gives you more control, Gnome is more streamlined and sleek). The one caveat is Linux Mint uses Cinnamon instead of the above two. It also resembles Windows.\n\n-For your case, a lot of posters are going to recommend gaming-centric OSes. They can be really good for your needs, but you should keep in mind one thing with Linux: Community is your support, and popularity=community. The bigger distros come with more knowledge when something breaks, and if you're on a niche gaming distro, your community support will be that much smaller.\n\n-quickly do some googling on \"immutable\". Some of the gaming distros are handheld focused (thinking of Bazzite specifically), which means they lock down your system files like a console. This can be great for newbie-proofing your system, but can also cause problems if you need a program to have access to specific files or places on your OS. I had issues with sandboxed apps when I was installing a DAW that I wanted to scan for VSTs in a part of my filesystem that was locked down. My fault, but it happens a lot when you expect full access to everything like in Windows.\n\n-If you do a lot of competitive multiplayer gaming, I would not make this switch lightly. Use ProtonDB to check support for your favorite games. Look up how the Anti-cheat behaves on Linux. You can get locked out of specific games if you're not careful."}

For the beginner user, there are several frustrations that they may run into.\n\nHere are some practical reasons why you should not use Manjaro:\n\n * Manjaro holds back Arch packages, but they do not hold back the AUR itself. This means that some AUR packages simply won't work due to incompatible library/packages, and you basically won't be able to do anything. For me this happened with Anbox, and KDE's Mauikit suite of apps, but I'm positive that this issue will occur with other packages. You don't actually get access to the full AUR, just most of it. \n * The AUR helper that they provide, pamac is slow, and it failed to compile packages many times when I used it. However, other AUR helpers I have used (I mainly use yay) are much faster, and they very rarely fail to compile packages.\n * Although Manjaro holds back packages, they don't actually intervene when their is a bug or a similar or a similar issue. And even if they did intervene, any patches made would bring new bugs/issues, and so on. There is no real point to holding back packages, and what they do just makes the system less stable. \n\n\nAnother big thing is that Arch is an entire terminal based, DIY distro, however, Manjaro has a completely opposite philosophy. Manjaro's philosophy is for users to never have to touch the terminal at all, and the clashing of philosophies of the parent distro and the derivative distro creates issues. We can see something similar with Ubuntu and Debian, but Ubuntu handles it much, much better due to the support of a larger company - support which Manjaro lacks. \n\nHere are some links to other articles, in which the authors point out other, more serious issues, such as unfixed security vulnerabilities. \n\nhttps://www.hadet.dev/Manjaro-Bad/\n\nhttps://github.com/arindas/manjarno \n\nThere is no true way to get \"Arch without the pain,\" because philosophy of Arch Linux brings what some users consider to be pain. If you want something close, I recommend EndeavorOS, a reputable and trusted distro with a fairly large community, or Garuda, a new and upcoming distro that has some minor issues but those can easily be overlooked. \n\nI don't recommend any kind of \"Arch installer,\" because by default, Arch does not come with things that many users would consider necessary, like Bluetooth or Printing. Although the Arch Wiki provides guides for setting those things up, if you aren't willing/able read the Arch Wiki in order to actually install Arch, why would you be willing/able to read the Arch Wiki in order to set up Bluetooth or printing? \n\n(Although I will admit that the guides to set up printing and bluetooth were vastly easier compared to the installation guide (couple minutes compared to a couple of hours), my point is still the same. Also, there are many other things the Arch Wiki provides guides to do.)", "output": "Your arguments make sense to me. I was a manjaro fan years ago, but I eventually switched to arch because I wanted to try it. Stuck with arch for some years and when my gf wanted to try Linux, I recommended her Manjaro.

You  never have to use the terminal to do anything on your system these days. You can install packages through your software manager. You can back things up through GUI interfaces like timeshift. You can copy files, move files, edit files in GUIs like Nautilus, Nemo, Dolphin, etc. You can change system settings in GUIs. **You don't have to use the terminal to do any of this.**\n\n##So why do you need to know the basics if you don't have to use it?\n\nAs a user of a computer you will hit some problem. You will find something you don't know how to do, some error message you don't understand, some aspect you want to change and can't find the setting for. When that happens you will go to a search engine and start looking up help. That might take you here or to the arch wiki or to some obscure forum or to some clickbait site. \n\nAnd here's the thing; it's difficult to write a guide to fully explain how to fix a problem through the GUI, especially when there's so much variety and customization available on Linux. \n\nTake installing software: one could say,\n\n> \"Ok go to the *Synaptic Software Center* or maybe go to *Ubuntu Software* or maybe click the thing that just says *Software* or maybe go to the *Pop Shop*... ok now find the search bar... it might be a little magnifying glass or maybe just a big white bar... unless you've changed the theme in which case maybe the icon or color is different, ok now search for the program... next click on the right version, no not that one, that's just plugins and not the actual program, ok now click the Install button.. or maybe it's just a little down arrow.\" \n\nor one can say, \n\n>\"open a terminal and type `sudo apt install <program> ` \"\n\nFor this reason almost all *advice*; error fixing, program installing, etc. is terminal based. It skips all the searching through menus to find the right option. It jumps past all the potential differences on each desktop. It's fast, easy and will work if followed exactly. \n\nNow, the terminal is a very fast, powerful and direct way of interacting with your computer. You give a command it will run it. As `sudo` will warn you the first time it is started 'with great power power comes great responsibility.' If you don't know even the basics, suddenly you will find yourself running commands you have no understanding of blindly and hoping they work. **That means trusting whoever it is that is telling you what commands to run on your computer.** \n\nFor example, you might look up how to install a program and find a whole set of commands you need to run on some shitty clickbait site. If you don't know what \"curl\" is, suddenly you might be downloading random zips from the internet and shoving them into core spots on your system. You might end up compiling something you cloned into your home directory via git clone. You might end up with a huge mess or something actively malicious if you downloaded code from from an unofficial source. When it turns out all you really needed to do was click install in your software manager. \n\nSo while you don't need to use the terminal.... you need to know how to use it.\n\n#tl:dr; You can do almost everything without the terminal but every guide to linux, forum help post, etc. will tell you commands to run and it's bad news bears to run things with no understanding of what strangers are telling you to do to your computer.", "output": "[deleted]"}

He's a curious kid, it's fine, I knew when I gave him the laptop that things like this might be in the cards no matter how much I urged him to come to me first before messing with the depths of the thing.

Mint is based off of Ubuntu but they modify enough of the system to be considered a different distribution.  Like Xubuntu Mint XFCE also uses the XFCE desktop environment.\n\n**My computer is modern**\n\n* Ubuntu – This is the most popular desktop distribution.  It uses the Gnome desktop environment which is very modern looking.  Since it is the most popular it is much easier to find solutions for issues on this distro since so many people use it.\n\n* PopOS – This distro has a more gaming oriented appeal but it works very well as an every day distro.  This is based on Ubuntu so almost any troubleshooting steps or guides you see for Ubuntu will work on this distro as well.\n\n* Manjaro – Unlike every other distro on this list, Manjaro is not based on Ubuntu.  Instead it is based on Arch.  What makes this different is that Arch always has the latest versions of software.  This can be bad as it can cause instability when updating.  Ubuntu based operating systems usually use software which is a few versions behind but it is more stable.", "output": "There is an entire sub for the question..\n\n/r/findmeadistro"}

Your computer will continue to work but since Windows 7 will be: 1) not uncommon, 2) lack security updates, 3) used mostly by  people who are not tech/security savvy and who ignored the warnings... it will become the juiciest target for malware out there right now. It'll be open season on grandparents and small businesses who are left on it.\n\nSo you have 2 options:\n\n1) upgrade to a newer version of Windows\n\n2) switch to Linux\n\nThis post is not going to be a Linux sales pitch. If you *want* Windows 10 and can run Windows 10 then install Windows 10.\n\n# \"Well what is Linux?\"\n\nLinux is a free operating system with an emphasis on open source software. It is free to download, try out and install. It is however, not Windows. Some things will work differently and there will be some of a learning curve for a new user.\n\n## Some things that work differently:\n\n* because it is free and open source, anyone can make their own version and distribute it to the community. We call each version put out by a particular group a \"**distro**\" for \"distribution.\" That's why you might see some ridiculously complicated graphs and suggestions for all the different versions of Linux (unlike with Windows where there are a few official versions all made by Microsoft)\n\n* because a lot of the software is free and open source, each distro can provide its users with a **repository** of a bunch of pre-packaged software designed to work on your system which you can install, run and update free of charge, this can then all be managed by a **package manager**. On the user side, this works like a phone app store where everything is free.\n\n* because it is free and open source, it can be seen as a threat to Microsoft making money so some software (*Microsoft Office*) will likely never be provided for Linux directly.\n\n* because it is less common than Windows, some companies simply don't make versions of their software for Linux. Adobe is a big one.\n\n# \"Ok, how do I try it out?\"\n\n## try out some Linux software on Windows before switching\n\nCheckout https://alternativeto.net/ , and search for any software you tend to use. You can then try out a lot of the stuff available for Linux on Windows too. (edit: this includes MS Office alternatives).\n\nFor an organized list of linux software there’s this: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/list_of_applications\n\n## Use a virtual machine\n\nUsing software like virtual box https://www.virtualbox.org/ you can run Linux inside a program on Windows. This is a really great way to try it because you can do whatever you want in the virtual machine (VM) without changing things on your actual machine. The downside is that your computer has to run both Linux and Windows at the same time while doing this so it might not work well on low spec hardware and it won't let you test that all everything works on your hardware. \n\n## Boot into the live environment\n\nLinux can actually run off of a USB stick. Doing this let's you test it out on your actual hardware and make sure that everything works correctly without changing anything on your harddrive. The downside is that you generally can't save changes while running off a USB stick so this is intended for testing, installing and recovering but not for extended use or experimentation.\n\n# \"I'm interested in trying it out, what should I start with?\"\n\n## Do you want something that looks different from windows?\n\nUbuntu is the classic newbie friendly Linux distro. By default it has a desktop environment that looks a little more like Mac than Windows but is distinctly different from both. Most Linux instructions online will include help on Ubuntu and there's lots of good forums to help. Ubuntu releases a new version every 6 months but maintains a long term support (LTS) release that is supported for 5 years. The 6 month version will have newer software, the LTS version will have (increasingly) older software but still get security updates for that supported time.\n\nUbuntu's install guide is here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall\n\n## Do you want a windows like desktop environment?\n\nLinux Mint is an even more newbie friendly Linux distro that is based on Ubuntu's LTS release. It's essentially just LTS Ubuntu with some extra help like backup integration and a more windows-like UI. That means basically all of the Ubuntu guides and help carry over but you'll feel more at home coming from Windows 7.\n\nLinux Mint's install guide is here: https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (and it's very well put together for a newbie)\n\n# \"Looks good! Now what?\"\n\nKnow that while you can do almost everything on Ubuntu and Mint through a graphical interface, a lot of advice and help will give you things to run on the commandline (even if you could do it other ways). Don't be scared of the commandline but also try to look up what you are running to understand it yourself; it's a way of telling your computer exactly what you want it to do... efficient and powerful if you know the basics but it's not a good idea to trust every random person who gives you a command to run from the internet.\n\nLinux malware/viruses are extremely rare and you won't get anything bad if you download from the official repositories. Part of the reason is that most of the time, you are not giving programs permission to install, update or change things on your system. To give them permission, you need to enter the \"root password\" so that anything where you aren't entering your password or typing \"sudo\" can only affect your documents and personal stuff but anything where you entering your password can make bigger changes to your system. Take note of anytime someone is telling you to add a new repository or download and run something from somewhere else. \n\nIf for some reason Ubuntu and Mint are not working for you, you can start branching out and trying other distros. Everyone's got their own favorite but these are just the best places to start.

{"id": "eo6dom", "instruction": "Tips from a Noob: The most helpful ideas I've learned in my first six months of using Linux (summary: Take NOTES, start snapshots immediately, and stick with best practices)", "input": "*Edit: Thank you, Anonymous user, for the Platinum! <3*\n\nI've been using Ubuntu 19.04/19.10 for six months and wanted to share what has helped me out the most so far in my journey. I'll keep this as succinct as I can. Here you go!\n\n## Take notes on any changes you make to your system\n\nThis includes every package you install. I have a `refs` directory in my Dropbox folder with some markdown files for different ideas I'm learning. I chose markdown to practice that format but text files work fine. I have files for:\n\n* **tmux:** commands and hotkeys I'm working on committing to memory\n* **vim:** commands, hotkeys, and notes on plugins (I mostly use neovim but still take notes in this file)\n* **ricing:** has a full, simplified markdown table of all my i3 keybindings (helps me see what hotkeys I'm NOT using yet!)\n* **webdev:** reminders of which webdev concepts were covered in the courses I've taken, plus an ongoing list of ideas for projects\n* **journey:** the ongoing plan I'm following for learning web development from HTML5 all the way up to React/Redux\n* **general linux:** has an **Installation Timeline** (any apt/snap/pip/pip3 install is noted here), **Things To Research** (if I see something online but don't have time to look into it, I put it in this section), **Script Ideas**, **Diagnostics** (sysadmin stuff I'm committing to memory), and a generic **Notes** section for when I do something tedious and don't want to forget it (like how I set up each of my drive's partitions/filesystems)\n* **markdown:** A full, super simple list of all markdown formatting so I can get better at creating repos while helping myself stay more organized\n\nThere is no need to do all of this, but I like this separation of ideas so it can scale with me for years. Whenever I start learning about something specific and vast enough to warrant extensive notes, I will make a new file.\n\nI have an alias for each file so they are always a few keystrokes away from being in front of me. You could also just alias the directory. I use `refX` where X is the letter for that file. `refv` for vim, `reft` for tmux, `refl` for general linux, and so on.\n\n**Edit:** An awesome suggestion from u/wrek: **\"Make ONE change at a time.\"** Super valid point. Make a habit of installing, then testing, making changes, then testing, and so on. If you do five things with no testing and find out something broke, you now have five directions to go. Even if what broke leads you to reaching out for help, you'll know exactly *how* to ask for help if you know what change caused the breaking.\n\n## Get to know your filesystem\n\nI'd suggest doing this before you get that far into installing anything, but it's never too late to know your filesystem.\n\n[This video from Engineer Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFIoRLqhFpo) and [this video from DorianDotSlash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbgzrKJvDRw) helped me a lot!\n\nAfter watching these, I stopped trying to manually install anything beyond the home directory. Some applications like [simple terminal](https://st.suckless.org/) or packages you download will automatically put themselves somewhere outside the home directory and I let those applications do what they were designed to do, but if I manually install stuff it is usually in `~/.local` or something like that.\n\nThis is what I meant by \"stick with best practices\". It seems ideal to stay out of most deeper directories until you know what you're doing. I'm still a noob so I'll stay at home where it's safe :)\n\n## Snapshots, Snapshots, Snapshots\n\nIf you haven't already, use something like [Timeshift](https://github.com/teejee2008/timeshift) or [rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) to start taking snapshots as soon as possible.\n\nThis suggestion saved my ass when I tried, stumbled, and failed at setting up as many applications as possible to change colors via pywal. I didn't keep track of how I set it all up and when I decided to try dismantling it, I couldn't remember how to get everything back to \"pre-pywal\" setup.\n\nLuckily I had a Timeshift snapshot from about 10 minutes after my fresh OS install. **Installing Timeshift and getting snapshots started, including taking an initial manual snapshot that would never get auto-deleted, is the first thing I did after installing Ubuntu.**\n\nThat was easily the smartest decision I made last year and it took about 12 minutes to undo a month's worth of disorganized configuring.\n\nAfter that, I started taking notes on everything I installed and set everything up more carefully. Although I've messed up small stuff since then, I have also been able to refer to notes and undo them no problem. My system (and brain) feel a lot more stable.\n\nMy Timeshift setup is pretty simple. I have daily snapshots and boot snapshots (max of 7 snapshots for each type), plus a few manual snapshots that get me back to \"10 minutes post-install\" if needed.\n\n## For non-system files, try to be cloud based\n\nAside from my Downloads folder, every file in my home directory is in Dropbox. Most folders in `$HOME` are symlinks to their equivalent in Dropbox, and I have automatic backups for anything else (like stuff from `~/.config`, `~/.fonts`, etc). Those are also backed up into Dropbox.\n\n**Edit:** This could also be done with a server you run/own, or another cloud storage service of some sort. The goal with this suggestion is to **have your files stored in a way that protects you from a drive failure**. Don't store everything only on your main working drive because you'll be screwed if it gives out. An external, ideally automated solution for file storage lets you pick back up where you left off immediately after replacing a drive without losing any data.\n\n## If you have time and interest, try doing something the hard way\n\nrsync is a great choice for backing up files in your home directory. I could have just used its extensive options, but decided it'd be fun to write a script that handles those backups instead. By doing that I wound up learning a lot about writing scripts.\n\nFor some reason I've had a hard time getting Dropbox to show up on Polybar. That tray icon is how I usually manage my sync settings. I can still log out of i3 and into GNOME to pull those settings up, but I realized I could also [make a Rofi-powered menu](https://github.com/NicksIdeaEngine/dropboxsyncmenu) to manage those settings. It was another fun learning experience in scripting, and more practice on setting up repositories.\n\n## Share your work!\n\nDid you write a script? Post it in r/bash and ask for input. You'll probably hear some great suggestions on simplifying or improving it!\n\nIf you love customizing, post your setup in r/unixporn for others to see.\n\nShare your creations. You'll get valuable feedback, help a fellow noob, or both!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTake notes, get to know your filesystem, start using snapshots if you haven't already, leverage the cloud, keep an eye out for fun challenges that'll force you to learn something, and if you make something useful go ahead and share it with the community.\n\nKnowing the easy AND hard way might seem redundant, but the point is practice. Someday you'll encounter something that doesn't have an easy solution, and you'll be better prepared if you've tackled challenging problems already.", "output": "Excellent article and suggestions.

Several distributions have been specifically designed to provide a Windows-like experience, a list of these is below. You could also try the [Linux Distribution Chooser](http://www.zegeniestudios.net/ldc/) (2011).\n\n**Windows-like distributions:**\n\n- [Lubuntu](http://lubuntu.net/) - [install guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/InstallingLubuntu)\n- [Xubuntu](http://xubuntu.org/)\n- [Kubuntu](http://kubuntu.org/)\n- [Linux Lite](https://www.linuxliteos.com/) - [install guide](https://www.linuxliteos.com/manual/install.html)\n- [Linux Mint - Mate edition](http://www.linuxmint.com/) (the heaviest one in this list)\n\n**Lightweight distributions:** (suited to older or low-powered hardware)\n\n- [Lubuntu](http://lubuntu.net/) - [install guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/InstallingLubuntu)\n- [CrunchBang Linux](http://crunchbang.org/)\n- [Bodhi Linux](http://www.bodhilinux.com/)\n- [DistroWatch search - \"Old Computers\" category](http://distrowatch.com/search.php?category=Old+Computers)\n- [list of Lightweight Linux distributions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Linux_distribution)\n\n**Important details:**\n\n- **Run a backup:** That way, even if you toast your machine, you will be able to recover your data. If your backup software has a \"verify\" feature, use it. You'll want to backup to an external device, if possible. Do NOT back up your data onto your existing C: drive, as if you somehow delete your C: drive during installation of Linux, your backup will be deleted too.\n- **CPU type:** When downloading Linux, ensure to select the correct build for your CPU. Many distributions have separate downloads for 32-bit or 64-bit CPU architectures - they also may have downloads for non-X86 CPUs. If you're migrating from Windows, you'll likely want X86, 32-bit or 64-bit.\n- **Dual-booting:** if you want to keep your Windows install, you can do that by using \"dual boot\", where you select which OS you want to use from a menu when you first power on the machine. This topic is a bit complex for this post, so we recommend making a post about it if you have queries (you could try [this search](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/search?q=dual+boot&restrict_sr=on) too). Dual-boot (sometimes called multi-boot) is a good way to experiment. However, you will need to have sufficient diskspace to hold both operating systems at once.\n- **Drivers:** This can get tricky, especially for newer, consumer-grade hardware. If you find a problem here, please make a post about it so we can assist. Using a live CD can show up problems here before you spend time on a full install.\n- **Applications:** Linux does not natively support Windows programs, so you'll need to find a \"workalike\" for each Windows application you use. You can also try [Wine](https://winehq.org/), which lets some Windows applications run on unix-like systems, including Linux. However this may not work for your particular needs, you'll need to test it to see. There is a compatibility list [here](https://appdb.winehq.org/). If you have DOS apps, try [DOSbox](http://www.dosbox.com/) or [DOSEMU](http://www.dosemu.org/). It's also possible to \"virtualize\" your Windows install, using software such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), and run it in a window under Linux.\n- **Secure boot:** newer machines have a feature which can prevent non-Windows operating systems from booting. You may need to disable Secure Boot in your BIOS if your hardware has this feature.\n\n**Recommended reading:**\n\n- [I'm thinking of making a complete switch to Linux, thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/1xu4u3/im_thinking_of_making_a_complete_switch_to_linux/)\n- [As a beginner, which build of Linux should I first install to learn the basics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/21b76u/as_a_beginner_which_build_of_linux_should_i_first/)\n- [L4NG: The basics of Linux](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/225f4r/l4ng_the_basics_of_linux/)\n- [What are your must haves for your Linux machine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/1w80uc/what_are_your_must_haves_for_your_linux_machine/)\n- [Need help picking a distro?

To get the latest Flash, you can either use Chrome, or install Flash player through Pipelight.\n\nNote that you should use your package manager to install programs, instead of downloading them from websites.\n\n**Migrating your data:**\n\n- Copy your personal files onto a USB drive.\n- Backup your browser profile onto the USB drive too so you can restore your bookmarks. This will only work if you will use the same browser. If you're changing browsers, try using the import feature of your new browser to restore your old bookmarks.\n- User data on Windows XP computers is usually found in the locations below:\n\n| item | location\n| ---|---\n| Desktop|C:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\Desktop \n| Favorites (Internet Explorer)|C:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\Favorites\n| My Documents|C:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\My Documents (note: the Downloads, Music, My Pictures, My Videos collections subdirectories may be large) \n| Contacts (Outlook Express)|C:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Address Book\n| Contacts (Outlook)|N/A - is contained in the PST\n| email (Outlook Express)|C:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\Identities\\XXXXX\\Microsoft\\Outlook Express (where XXXXX is a long string of alphanumeric characters)\n| email (Outlook 2003)|C:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Outlook\n\nNotes: \n\n- This list is *not* complete - it covers the standard locations for popular software only.\n- Each user on a Windows XP machine has a separate profile, these are all stored in the *C:\\Documents and Settings* directory. Ensure to copy the data for each profile on the system.\n- Some directories (eg. Application Data) may be hidden, to browse to them, first enable \"show hidden files and folders\" (not detailed here).\n\n**Migration tips:**\n\n- When you're installing, try and have access to a second computer with a working internet connection. If you run into problems during the install, you can use the other computer to search for a solution.\n- If you encounter problems, don't forget to try any \"test installation media\", \"test memory\" and/or \"test hard disk\" options you may be offered.\n- Use the same wallpaper on your new Linux installation, it'll help make the transition easier.\n\n**Todo list for this doc:**\n\n- data: how to migrate? \n- partitioning: best practice, allowing for dual-boot\n- devices: common catches with cameras, smartphones, printers (esp. iTunes)\n- links to this kind of doc elsewhere on the web\n\n**Contributors to this doc:**\n\n- /u/PaperPlaneFlyer123, /u/Pi31415926, /u/provocatio, /u/spammeaccount\n\n**More information:**\n\nIf you have queries, please add your comment, or make a new post, we are happy to help.\n\n\\* That's [free as in freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software), not free as in free beer.

It really isn't as difficult as you might think.\n\nI wanted to share a story about what happened to me this morning that made me glad I learned just a little bit about how the terminal works. I was removing some font packages that were automatically installed with Cinnamon desktop that are for non-Latin alphabets, that I would never ever use, and just clog up my font list in LibreOffice. Well, apparently removing one of those packages caused several dependencies to also be removed and I was being quite careless, and it turned out those dependencies were integral to the functioning of my desktop, so much so that in the middle of my terminal session, the desktop stopped functioning, the screen turned black and the computer went back to the boot screen.\n\nI booted and lo and behold, all that would display was a black screen with blocky white letters asking me to enter my username and password. Basically I had no graphical desktop, I just had access to a terminal. 8 months ago, heck, even 2 months ago, I would have freaked out, probably grabbed my USB and just re-installed my OS, erasing all my data. But, because I had taken the time to learn a few commands I was able to calmly learn a few things. \n\nFirst I logged in and executed a list command (ls) to see whether I had lost any of my files or if this was a desktop issue. Luckily I saw all my folders intact. Next I was able to run neofetch, which is a program I installed which displays information about your system along with a logo in terminal (its pretty neat). Everything looked ok, but there was no desktop environment listed. So it just came down to having to reinstall the desktop, which I was able to do by running the simple install command and installing Cinnamon desktop again. \n\nAfter rebooting, the desktop came back online and amazingly was even still configured exactly as I left it.\n\nBy knowing 2 basic commands I was able to correct a small mistake that seemed huge. So I really encourage new users to take the time how to do a few basic things in the terminal in the event that something like accidentally breaking your desktop environment happens, you can confidently and proudly correct it.", "output": "[deleted]"}

{"id": "6pgu7a", "instruction": "They say Linux is for normal people these days, but it feels like they think \"normal people\" are all CS majors [LONG]", "input": "I have to prelude this by saying that I consider myself a generally competent end user.  I was raised in an OS-9 household and made the transition to Windows in middle school because I wanted to get in on some of that sweet Monkey Island action.  I know the install location of every program on my personal PC, I always run as Admin if the software doesn't work the first time, and I know how to google error codes and follow step-by-step instructions to make registry edits.  I don't really understand what's going on under the hood of my OS at any given time, but I am circumspect enough to do general troubleshooting.  For the most part, my computer and I get along fine.\n\nThat said, I've become more peripherally aware in the last year or so of the sort of money-grubbing bullshit Microsoft pulls (I know, I know; I'm young) and the bizarre, arbitrary restrictions they put on how users are allowed to use the OS.  The philosophy behind Linux is so comparatively enticing, even if for all practical purposes I really don't have the skills or interest to utilize the customization capabilities myself.  It's free, after all, so why not give Linux a try?  \n\nAnd, I mean, I did.  But even aside from the part where I managed to destroy my laptop's hard drive doing so (long story, not Mint's fault), I've left the experiment feeling very discouraged.\n\nThe thing I keep noticing over and over is that every guide which calls itself an \"intro to Linux\" or \"Linux for normal people\" or even \"Linux for Windows users\" seems geared toward users who are prepared to do deep work tinkering the OS itself (Bash, GNU, etc) rather than use the GUI as it's given.  Most of these guides start off with how to navigate the directory through the terminal, FFS.  I know it's a valuable skill to have, but I care a lot more about first learning to navigate the directory from the *desktop.*  \n\nI do not do network administration or development or coding.  Neither am I the sort of user who only checks their email and browses the internet.  I have a few particular programs I use very frequently (Manga Studio, MusicBee, Scrivener, a handful of non-AAA games) and my goal is to be able to continue to use them; I'm a simple woman.  I understand how the path through the Windows directory works, and I know how installation ties into that - you find a location in Program Files [(x86)] and there you put your executable and all related files, probably with a shortcut to the desktop.  If you want to keep backups for the save files of a game, find the default or custom location for those files and store them on an external drive or the cloud.  It comes very naturally after so many years using a PC.  Finding a simple but thorough \"compare and contrast\" introductory guide, however, one which uses Windows as a practical reference point for understanding Linux (\"you're used to having a C: drive, but Linux doesn't use that.  Instead, we have the root directory...\") has been surprisingly difficult.  I know that trying to understand one OS as a variation on the other isn't how you come to really comprehend how it works, but it would make me feel much steadier on my feet starting out.  It seems to me that those more foundational skills should come later.\n\nStupidly simple example question: Linux doesn't use .exe files, so does it have a direct equivalent?  Is there a default install location for software a la Program Files? If not, what does it do upon installing a new program instead?  How the heck does the whole process work?  And why am I struggling to find an easy-to-understand answer to this question?\n\nI don't know.  If you've made it this far into my long whine, you may be thinking that if the only reason I'm interested in moving to Linux is to make a statement, then it's really not for me, and that may very well be right.  I suppose I just wish that the community didn't keep throwing out the line that Linux is for everybody these days, and then begin every stable distro's introductory guide with how to navigate your files without a mouse.  Of course, if I have any fundamental misunderstandings about this, please say so.  I really am interested -- just overwhelmed.  Thanks for reading.\n\nEDIT: I really appreciate the feedback from everyone here.  I haven't had a chance to respond to every post, but I'm reading all of it.  You're all so encouraging!", "output": "> I would love to find an easy-to-understand guide to what's happening when you use Wine to run an .exe.\n\nRunning an executable on Windows isn't much different from running an executable under Linux. The language of an executable is specific to the processor, not the operating system.\n\nTrouble is, the executables do need the operating systems' help to do anything useful, like writing to the screen or reading a file. Most programs don't know how to read a file – they instead go to the great library of functions and ask for help there.\n\nIn the Windows world, this means going to `CoolLibrary.dll` and using its `open_a_file_please()` function.  \nIn the Linux world, this means going to `freeLibrary.so` and using its `get_a_file_for_me()` function.\n\nSo what does Wine do? It starts `Program.exe` in such a way that it can intercept its visits to the library. When `Program.exe` goes to `CoolLibrary.dll`, Wine assumes the role of CoolLibrary. The program then asks for `open_a_file_please()` and Wine says – no problem, right on my way.\n\nWine knows that `open_a_file_please()` corresponds to `get_a_file_for_me()` and translates everything so that `freeLibrary.so` can take over. After `freeLibrary.so` did its thing, Wine will translate whatever came back so that it makes sense to `Program.exe`.\n\nSo, Wine squeezes itself between an .EXE and the Linux environment, and translates what happens on the interface between program and operating system.\n\nDoes that make sense to you?"}

And, the funny thing is, nothing of that happened on Windows, so the answer was pretty obvious... or was it?\n\nI was ready to give up once again, but after seeing Microsoft's plan to push even more the \"suggestions\" and ads on Windows, I tried to stick on linux and try to learn why all those problems were present to fix them.... just to fail epically soon after.\n\nAnyway, after an update which contained some kernel stuff, my pc started to show a couple of messages regarding  USB issues, messages that weren't there before.\n\nThings about some usb ports not starting correctly, so I read some sites and a lot of those problem were related to some BIOS configuration and faulty or damaged usb ports.

So I revisited the BIOS, saw that everything was fine, the problem was still there.\n\nSo I unplugged everything, started to check all my usb ports one by one, all of the back ones were perfectly fine, but one of the front seemed damaged, so I unplugged the front ports from the motherboard to see if that fixed anything.\n\nAnd well... all seem to work now.\n\nNo USB issues, not random sound cuts nor video cuts, not system slowdowns, it looks like just.... it just works.\n\nI know more issues will rise as I'll use this everyday (like tha fact that cinnamon for some reason decides to force my keyboard to english and don't show me \"Latinamerican spanish\" as an option, just \"spanish\"), but I don't know what could have happen if I just switched back to windows and ignored that hardware issue.\n\nLinux forced me to read, to learn and to fix something that could potentially made a bigger problem in the future.\n\n  \nUpdate: Well, the video/audio cuts are still present, but that's the only issue right now and a very little small price to pay.\n\nI've been playing GTA IV and the cut itself is much smaller than a second, is noticeable because of the audio cut, but it doesn't affect the gameplay, and it's weird, it can happen after 20 seconds or after 20 minutes, it doesn't matter if I'm playing something heavy or just watching some random video on youtube.\n\nBut that aside, I'm feeling very confortable with the system and it stays.", "output": "Firstly Never apologise for writing in a completely different language that’s not your native tongue. \nSecondly there is nothing more satisfying than fixing something yourself"}

I'm putting out a tutorial series on just that.", "input": "Hey guys,\n\nfirst of all, let me introduce myself. My name is Mislav Jurić and I'm a recent computer science master's degree graduate. I am interested in AI, tech startups and software engineering.\n\nI first started using Linux on my computer about 2 years ago and I'm still using it. Albeit I have used Linux for 2 years, for the first year and a half I was using Linux mostly through GUI and everything I didn't understand I would Google. Googling stuff is OK, I've got nothing against it, but I didn't have the foundational knowledge of how Linux actually worked under the hood. I didn't know what the commands in the tutorial I found on Google were doing to my operating system.\n\nWhen I started working as a software engineer (there I also used Linux), I decided it was time for me to learn how Linux works and the basic commands that would be very useful to know. I read three books for that purpose:\n\n* Barrett, D. J. (2016). *Linux pocket guide* (3rd ed.). O’Reilly Media.\n* Shotts, W. (2019). *The Linux Command Line, Fifth Internet Edition*. Retrieved from [http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php)\n* Ward, B. (2014). *How Linux Works: What Every Superuser Should Know* (2nd ed.). No Starch Press.\n\nAfter reading those books, I had the knowledge of the foundational concepts of the Linux operating system. I am by no means an expert, but I think I know the basics.\n\nI thought to myself: \"Hey, there are probably people out there dealing with this situation as well.\". So I made a Linux Tutorial Series primarily aimed at people completely new to Linux and for software engineers who have never used Linux before. You can find it [here](http://www.mislavjuric.com/category/linux-tutorial-series/). I've got both written and video version of it (video resides on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAiVTP4ez4s&list=PLyscv5D4FoIi1CU_HsV1j1QPafNSlY0dJ)). The tutorial series has some videos where I explain fundamental operating system concepts. I think that in order to understand Linux well, you need to understand the basics of how operating systems work. If you're a software engineer, you can glance over those parts, but for people that haven't got a computer science background... Well, you're in for a treat!\n\nAs I said, I don't deem myself an expert in Linux. For that reason, I created [Linux Stories](http://www.mislavjuric.com/category/linux-stories/), which is a podcast where I bring in guests who have been using Linux for longer than me. It's a supplement to the Linux Tutorial Series and it's there if people ever want to go farther than the Linux Tutorial Series will take them. ([YouTube link to Linux Stories playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRXCaArl8WE&list=PLyscv5D4FoIi5D6sXURtDnW4y75nhr8nv)). I also post some content unrelated to Linux, such as a podcast around AI, startups and software engineering called [Interesting Conversations with Mislav Jurić](http://www.mislavjuric.com/category/interesting-conversations-with-mislav-juric/). This is my personal brand, so I'm putting out content related to everything I'm interested in.\n\nI am present on various social media platforms, as you can see from [my website](http://www.mislavjuric.com/).  Feel free to follow me on any social media platform you find convenient. My preference is YouTube and my newsletter. Although I've never sent out a newsletter before, I want to do it only when I have something juicy and interesting, such as a really cool podcast episode or a very thoughtfully written blog post. Don't worry about getting thousands of boring emails - I hate that too.\n\nI hope you find this useful!\n\nBest,  \nMislav", "output": "6 months is more than enough to learn the CLI and how to use it effectively.

{"id": "gz0b13", "instruction": "I'm losing it with linux", "input": "I'm really struggling to adapt to using linux. I started work in a new field this year (computational chemistry) and was told by everyone in my office that I shouldn't use windows, that I should switch to linux. I asked which distro and was told to use Ubuntu unanimously by everyone in the office. Since I'm working from home, and my pc is on Windows 10, I've been using Ubuntu 20.04 on a Hyper-V VM.\n\nThe problem I've having is that I'm supposed to be getting work done, but instead I spend hours battling my OS and troubleshooting. Things that I assume should be simple such as installing a program take me hours or days to figure out. There's about 50 different ways of installing programs on linux and I can never know which one is correct for the program I'm currently installing/trying to use. Of course any info when I google the problem the info is years out of date and doesn't work anymore. Not to mention everyone always assumes you have at least some rudimentary knowledge of how linux works. So I end up spending hours trying to learn how linux works, instead of just using linux to do my work.\n\nI'm extremely frustrated and losing my head, I found myself screaming at my computer which I've never done before in my life. Every single thing I want to do requires me googling it, spending ages reading outdated askubuntu pages, then ending up asking a new question on askubuntu and just hoping someone helps me out (which I would appreciate tremendously), which just doesn't happen, 6 questions asked over the past few months and no answers. And then when I ask a question and try move on to solving some other issue I have, askubuntu tells me I have to wait 40mins between asking questions. So I'm using these 40mins to blow off some steam and have a rant here.\n\nNot sure what to do other than power through this learning period. Thanks for reading my rant.\n\ntl;dr I'm spending more time battling my OS than using it.", "output": "While there are some people who would disagree with this, but there is no shame to use windows. I see the OS as a tool, and you need to use the tool you are the most productive with. I would recommend doing the work the way you are most productive with and continue to experiment inside a VM when you have the time. When you start to feel comfortable in the VM then you can start to transition your work away from windows and into linux.\n\nIts true that there are some good advantages of Linux over windows, but no advantage matters if you are struggling to use it.\n\nI have found that the best way to learn linux is to break it. Use the VM and just experiment. Try to install programs through the different ways. If there is something that you don’t like, just use the VM to roll it back and try something different. Dive into the configs and try to customize it to work better for you. When you break the OS, you can roll it back and now you know what not to do. I learned so much more by taking risks and failing then trying to find a single perfect answer on google. Once you start to understand how linux works, it gets a lot easier to troubleshoot problems. Just a warning, if you plan on experimenting, be careful not to use any paid licenses that you could possibly lose."}

One day, suddenly I’ve realized that Windows and OS X  are both full of **bloatware**  which I find really annoying, primarily because I like everything to be  perfectly aligned in the order I want it to be. After a little bit of  googling on the internet I’ve found many interesting operating systems  which were available for me, but none of them seemed as a long term  project which will continue to grow, except a few similar ones. From my  computer experience I’ve been listening to people talking about Linux  Kernel, but I didn’t want to know much about it. Time has passed, and  I’ve finally picked one which I liked. And it’s name is **Ubuntu**.  I know that many people are going to complain about my choice, which is  probably the most common one, but don’t get me wrong, Fedora and  Mint(another Ubuntu, I know) would have made me satisfied if they had  more appealing user interface. And here the journey begins.\n\n## Preparing for a switch\n\nI  couldn’t listen to people talking about Virtual Machines running Linux  as it is not what I wanted. I knew it wasn’t able to handle neither 3D  nor 2D game development and design. I’ve started diving into deep waters  straight from the beginning. Since I’m a programmer, as I’ve mentioned  earlier, I’m used to running both Windows and Mac OS. Therefore I had to  use a dual-boot computer as my daily driver, which I enjoyed. So I did  have a lot of dual-booting, triple-booting or even quad-booting  experience. I downloaded one third party USB Disk creation tool and put  an ISO onto it and went through installer step by step. I thought I was  up and running, there is only a few other software left to install, yet  the simplest thing in my life, huh. No. Lots of things were going bad  from the start. WiFi is working, I suppose, well at least there is icon  indicating it on the top, well it kinda works. OK, I say, maybe it’s my  adapter so I’ll have some trouble in future, but who cares, I think,  there’s a whole lot of new stuff to figure out. At this point I hope  that all the necessary software is installed, like on my Mac or Windows.\n\n## Whole, lot trouble in front of me\n\nI’ve  tried to use my PC but I see something is going wrong, I’ve got a  $1,500 worth PC and it can’t even play a 720p video. I’ve messed up  something for sure. I test my WiFi speed an it’s 1.5 megabit per second,  wow, I say it can’t be, on OS X it is nearly ten times faster! I’ve got  to fix this, I say. I google up a bit on the internet and find out that  I’ve got one of the least supported adapters which is knows for being  messy. OK, I’ll try some online guides. I’m going all over the internet  and trying, trying, trying… But no use. It seems as if my Linux journey  is coming to an end. And from nowhere I get an e-mail that my Ubuntu  Forum Thread has finally gotten a reply. And he is able to solve my  problem using open source drivers. Yup, I’ve finally got good internet  speeds, let’s give Youtube a try. Now 720p videos play, kinda, there’s a  lot of lag in them. Oh, I see! My GPU driver is not installed, let’s  fix it. I open up AMD website, look up my HD6970 and I find some  downloadable .tar.gz files. OK, some more troubleshooting and I’ve found  the install.sh file. I run through the wizard and it fails with some  stupid error (AMD, don’t be shit). Well, I guess I’ll need some open  source drivers I guess. I find some Barts drivers and install them and I  get pretty good results, obviously not as good as on Windows or OS X,  but pretty close. Now, my computer is able to handle both 3D and 2D  rendering which is great! Now, I’m more of a private guy so I try to set  up a DNS server, but it again ain’t work. Brhhh, I hate you Linux! But  again after some troubleshooting, changing repositories and installing  different WiFi manager app I get it to work.\n\n## Installing the important software\n\nNow,  that I’ve met Linux a bit, I know that it’s not like Windows, which  provides you with installation wizards, but more like a database  including all needed software in repositories. I got used to it and I’m  starting to like it :). Now it’s time to throw some software on it.  After a little time, I got all of my daily apps installed, which  included VLC Media Player, Libre Office, Firefox and Addons, Filezilla  and some other apps. Now it’s time to start building apps and games, I  say. I open Unity website and look for Unity 3 installer, but there is  no Linux option. Somewhere on the internet I find Unity installer which  was ported to Linux and download it as .deb file. Everything is up and  running except my graphics apps. I’m more of the **Adobe**  guy, so I liked Adobe CS4 Master Collection, eventually I realized that  it’s not available on Linux. Remember running .exe on OS X? Well **Wine**  runs in ans saves the day again! Installing and activating Adobe apps  isn’t much of a deal and Illustrator, Photoshop, Fireworks and  Dreamwaver are here. Again, as with benchmarks, performance isn’t  perfect but can still do the job. Finally I’ve gotten all of the needed  apps with the exception for Visual Studio which hasn’t been ported to  neither Mac nor Linux, and situation for Linux hasn’t changed today  (unlike with Mac).\n\n## Customizing Ubuntu, making it kinda appealing\n\nBack  in the days, Windows was customizable, with a little bit of tweaking  registry you could have made it just the way you wanted, unlike today.  Linux was more of OS which was just starting to gain fame, even though  it was over ten years old. Ubuntu lacked in app themes, icon packs,  shell themes etc. I’ve found some wallpapers online and made them  shuffle on the desktop again with the help of open source apps. Icon  packs were available but I found them more beautiful than on windows,  because of unity’s squared icons, so everything seemed nice and clean.  Lack of animations made me a proud Linux user, as everything felt  snappier than on other platforms. The only problem that I really had,  was that my desktop was zoomed in a bit, not much but about 3–4 pixels. I  found a solution in terminal and even though my monitor had a bit of  the black bars it was better.\n\n## Learning Shell\n\nTerminal,  your Linux’ best friend is basically like a command prompt if you’ve  never used Unix based OS like Mac OS. It wasn’t much of a change for me,  because I’ve had some Terminal knowledge but actually on my Mac Pro, I  used mostly Windows. I had to get used to using **sudo** (windows calls it Admin), apt, dpkg, git etc. If you’re planning to switch to Linux, the best way of preparing would be **Chocolatey**.  If you have ever used Sublime Text, you will probably know what I’m  talking about. Most of the users won’t need to know many commands, only  about fifteen commands. There’s also a good blog that covers many topics  about Linux called **It’sFOSS**, which I highly recommend.\n\n## What I got after switching to Linux\n\nAt  first it seemed as a completely new but useless experience as most of  the things I’ve been doing were able to be done on Windows or Mac OS,  but after some time I got to like some things about Linux. First of all  and one of the key things, it’s completely **free** and **open-source**  (except for some of distros). This feature really stands out in the  world of operating systems. There is source available for many apps and  operating systems, so you can customize them just the way you want and  be able to pack them into an ISO disk image, which I really appreciate,  so that all of my software can come preinstalled. Another useful thing  is that as a tech geek I’ve come across many risky websites. I’ve gotten  viruses or malware from there sometimes on Windows even though I can  recognize them and delete them immediately, but on Linux situation is a  bit different. Virus software is unable to make any mess without root  permission, which I must grant it, therefore it can’t damage my  operating system. Throughout the years, Linux has gotten great app  support for developers and designers, and all of them are stored in one  place. Apps like Visual Studio Code, Atom Text Editor, Android Studio  and many more are stored in Snaps library and those can be easily  installed within 2–3 commands. Another great thing which I like about  Linux is **no existence of installation wizards**.  I know that Wizards help newbies in installation process, but  disagreeing and agreeing with bunch of stupid statements and installing  bloatware is waste of time for me. Linux has also become my Home Server.  I can share all of my photos, videos, documents, downloads etc. It has  become like a cloud server with a few lifetime terabytes of storage.  Linux has also fixed my **HDD** boot times, as it is quite a lightweight operating system, so that I don’t need to store OS on my SSD.\n\n## What I miss in Linux\n\nPersonally,  I’ve been a fanboy for many years. At first I really liked Apple, after  that I started to like Microsoft and I’ve become a Linux fanboy in last  couple of years. I’ve made many compromises when using Linux and have  switched from many industry standard software to free alternatives, but  still there are some software packages that can’t be changed. Wine has  made my Linux life a lot easier but still **Video Editing**  software hasn’t been ported to Linux. Adobe Premiere always fails to  render and Magix (primarily Sony) Vegas hasn’t still been ported to  Wine. There are still some alternative software available fir you such  as DaVinci Resolve and Kdenlive. DaVinci Resolve has been used for color  correction in the film industry for quite a long time now and now it  packs more features focused on professional video editing. My all time  best IDE Visual Studio can’t manage to run in virtual machine nor Wine.  Therefore I still have to use Windows to run it in dual boot. Another  big minus in Linux is no existence of **.NET**  framework, but Mono project which doesn’t seem nearly as functional as  Microsoft’s option. Another tool I miss is a MPC-HC which is in my  opinion one of the best media players, which produces the best colors in  video playback.\n\n## Should you switch to Linux?\n\nUsually  at this point people will tell you that it is totally up to you and  that they can’t know answer to questions of this type. I’m going to give  you a few tips that will help you with making your choice. First of all  you should decide whether you want to install Linux on the computer you  already own or buy a new PC. If your choice is to install it on  computer you already own, I recommend looking up drivers online before  starting an installation. If your PC uses Intel HD graphics or Nvidia  graphics chip, low DPI monitor and Ethernet cable, you are already good  to go, whereas if your PC uses **AMD graphics card**, **high DPI** monitor and **Wireless**  adapter you should look them up in this way : Series name for GPU (for  example Turks), Monitor Model and Wireless Adapter Chip (for exaple  Rtl8192 not Netis 2116). Otherwise if you choice is to buy new PC, don’t buy PC made for Windows, look for parts that are Linux supported.Once  you’ve found out that your parts are Linux supported, you should pick  right distribution for you. Some of most popular and most supported are  Linux Mint, Fedora, CentOS, Ubuntu, Lubuntu, Arc Linux, Parrot Linux,  Puppy Linux etc. For a system administrator I would recommend going for a  Linux Mint, for developers Ubuntu or Arc, for lower powered PCs Lubuntu  or Puppy Linux, for those who care for privacy Parrot is my No. 1.If you plan mostly **gaming**  on Linux, the solution has been released recently. There is a tool on  GitHub called DXVK. It is still not that stable, but stable enough to  run most titles in Wine.**Cross-platform app developers** shouldn’t switch to Linux in my opinion as it doesn’t support leading frameworks, but if you plan to do **Javascript**, **Ruby**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Java** or even **C#**  game development I would highly recommend it. There are all of the  needed tools, you can run your databases and secure them much easier  then on Windows or Mac.What about **hacking**?  Well short answer, yes and no. Hacking is quite complex and not  everybody can be hacker. Linux is a good base for starting hacking. **Debian** and any other Debian based operating system can be used for this purpose, but many people recommend **Kali Linux** or **Parrot Linux**.

Graphics units are currently the  most profitable way of mining and many of them have worse performance  than on Windows, so if profit is your main goal than avoid Linux. Mining  a less popular coin may sound interesting to you, so in this case Linux  is your best friend, as many developers start small nowadays on **GitHub**.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLinux  is a user friendly operating system which is trying to get its  attention, but maybe it’s time just hasn’t come yet. Power users may  find it difficult that there are no their favorite apps, but still there  are free alternatives which may fit your needs. Switching to it made me  a favor, as there are no more annoying Windows apps which many of you  didn’t even know existed, so I’m finally free of bloatware.If you found this article helpful please consider sharing and commenting and as always keep safe until next time :).I  want to thank all of you who supported me on Reddit r/Linux4Noobs and I  want to give big thanks to people who made this article possible : [u/Wojakusesarch](https://www.reddit.com/user/Wojakusesarch) | [u/aikilink](https://www.reddit.com/user/aikilink) | [u/frankandgalculator](https://www.reddit.com/user/frankandgalculator) | [u/metmike07](https://www.reddit.com/user/metmike07) | [u/redditandom](https://www.reddit.com/user/redditandom/) | [u/Cactoos](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cactoos/) | [u/tdreampo](https://www.reddit.com/user/tdreampo/) | [u/takethecannoli4](https://www.reddit.com/user/takethecannoli4)", "output": "To me, it's simple.

{"id": "1k9606m", "instruction": "Trying out Arch Linux because of Pewdiepie...", "input": "Yes. We all know it. We have seen the video.\n\nBut personally for me. Me and my friend has been thinking about trying out Linux for a very long time now, it's just that we didn't care enough to actually try it out. But then after Felix built his first PC, he installed Linux Mint on that thing and Arch Linux on his laptop and saw how cool it is to customize your own desktop and everything and I thought maybe I should try it out. I mean there is nothing to lose if I try it out.\n\nNow I know that Linux Mint is RECOMMENDED for beginners trying out Linux, but for me, I really wanted to try out Arch Linux no matter how hard it is. I'm planning on Dual-booting it with my old extra HDD that's installed in my PC (I have 2 other SSDs btw), I just don't know how to do it.\n\n=====\n\nEDIT: WIth all things considered. I decided to go with what the comments say. I'll try out Linux Mint first because that's what Felix did before moving to Arch Linux and see where I go from there. Still worried about the Dual Booting though.\n\n=====\n\nEDIT 2: I have successfully installed Linux into my old spare HDD with ease. Create a Flash Media or something like then flash it using balenaEtcher, then Live Boot off of that, then from there you can choose to try it out or install directly there. If you did choose to install it from Live Boot, it's a pretty straightforward proccess, it's like installing a program from Windows, just be careful which drive you mount your Linux from. It also downloads GRUB for you so Dual-Booting is already solved.", "output": "\"I really wanted to try out Arch Linux no matter how hard it is\"\n\nOk, but a few things to think about before you progress. Firstly, don't come back in a few weeks complaining about how nothing works and Linux sucks. It's one thing to want to learn something challenging but too many people think they're so clever and then blame the system when stuff doesn't work. Don't do that.\n\nI also want to make sure that it's Arch you want and not just Hyprland. You can run Hyprland on any reasonably up to date distro - it doesn't have to be Arch. I run it on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. I'd recommend picking something like Fedora or Tumbleweed and trying Hyprland with those.\n\nNext, make sure that you have a good reason for picking Arch. A lot of people pick it because of the reputation but don't even understand why you choose Arch over other distros. I switched over to Linux a year and half ago and tried Arch but it was more of a headache than it was worth for me because I didn't need super cutting/bleeding edge packages. Tumbleweed works for me because it's rolling, pretty up to date, but far more reliable. Make sure you actually know what's different before you go all in on Arch.\n\nFinally, you have come to a forum asking for help to create an install media. What that shows is you haven't been able to Google \"Arch Linux\" and follow the instructions on the website. You also don't know what a virtual machine is or why you may want to test there first. Your level of computer knowledge is pretty limited. This isn't to call you out or gatekeep but you also need to know what you're walking into. Arch is designed for people who will troubleshoot their own problems and read the extensive literature. If you have to ask basic questions, you should not be using Arch.\n\nI love that you're inspired to use Linux and that's a great thing. But going into Arch will give you a negative experience. I'm not being an asshole by trying to tell you that. Please try something else first, understand the basics of what Linux even is, then go to Arch when you're more confident. Otherwise you'll just end up another person crying that Linux sucks or the community is mean."}

{"id": "12j9chi", "instruction": "Demystifying the CPU: what x86, x86_64, i386, i686 and AMD64 mean", "input": "Hi there folks. In my time here trying to be a good egg and helping folks, I have seen may doubts about how many bits your CPU has, what version is the adequate, \"I have an Intel CPU but I only see AMD64 as download option\", and other questions related.\n\nWell, this post aims to clarify doubts that gravitate around this topics.\n\nFirst of all, we need to talk about two characteristics a CPU has:\n\n# Bit Length\n\nI assume you already know that CPUs and by extent computers work with zeroes and ones that we call bits. Well, those bits come always in groups, the most famous being 8 bits, and we call that a *byte*.\n\nBut because of math, with 8 bits we can only count from 0 to 255, so with time and newer tech computers started to use more and more bits inside them. The amount of bits the CPU uses to process things is called a *word*.\n\nNowdays computers are 64 bit, meaning that the world length of your average computer is 64 bits long, but from the mid 90's to late 2000's most computers were 32 bit, and it is not rare to see some of them now and then.\n\n# CPU Architecture\n\nIn the end, a CPU is a really complex integrated circuit that reads the instructions that make a program, and then executes them. But that does not say what instructions are available, and how the CPU handles them and makes something useful of them.\n\nAll of that is dictated by the CPU Architecture. as the name implies, the architecture is how things are laid out in the CPU, dictating how it works, and more importantly the *set of instructions* it can understand and thus, work on.\n\nBack in the day architectures popped right and left, each with their own proprietary instruction set. But nowdays, only a handful of Instruction sets are used, and CPU architectures are made to comply to those sets, so nowdays saying CPU architecture or instruction set is almost the same.\n\nI need to remark this: word length and CPU architecture are **NOT** the same. the word length (how many bits your CPU handles) is a part on the CPU architecture, but not the entire architecture. You can have a 64-bit ARM CPU, a 64-bit RISC-V CPU and so on. Think of it as how many wheels a truck has vs what type of engine it has.\n\nSaid that, let's get to the topic shall we?\n\nAlthough several architectures exists out there like ARM, RISC-V and PowerPC, currently the most prominent CPU architecture out there is the so called x86. Put simply, if you have an Intel or AMD CPU, you have an x86 CPU.\n\n# x86 A.K.A i386 A.K.A IA-32\n\nIt all starts in the late 70's when intel made the **intel 8086** CPU. it was simply a 16-bit version of the early intel 8080, but because it was used on the IBM PC (well, a cousin of it, the 8088), it became an instant hit, not only because of IBM, but because all the so called *IBM Compatible* machines that came after, with brands like Acer, Compaq, HP, Dell, and other you may have heard.\n\nBecause of it's popularity Intel kept improving them, with the release in 1982 of the **intel 80186** and the **intel 80286** which were compatible with the OG 8086, because all had the same instruction set.\n\nin 1985 intel took the step to the 32-bit realm with the launch of the intel 80386, and launching it with the name **i386** (dropping the 80 in the front). It was still compatible with it's predecessors to an extent.\n\nin 1989 the next chapter came in the saga: the intel **i486**. Do you guys have seen the pattern yet? all CPUs of this *lineage* end in 86. That is the reason this architecture is called x86. Another name given to is is IA-32, standing for Intel Architecture - 32 bit.\n\nBu the early 90's intel tried to crush their competitors and attempted to trademark i586 and subsequent x86 naming, but that did not worked, so in 1993, the fifth instance on the saga came out: **Pentium**, coming from the greek word for five: penta. Some people still liked to call it **i586** tho.\n\nThe next iteration came as the P6 microarchitecture, that saw the light as the Pentium Pro and Pentium II and Pentium III. Because of that people like to call this generation of CPU's **i686**.\n\nPeople nowdays don't keep the count of what generation of something86 as the CPUs of today have more ranges and tiers, but in the core, they are all descendants of the i386.\n\nThe intel i386 was the first x86 CPU to be 32-bit, so it serves as a lowest common denominator for modern x86 hardware. that is the reason software written for x86 32 bit computers is often labeled as **i386**, **x86** or sometimes **x32** (the latter more common in windows). If I may go into *ackthsually* mode, x86 refers to the instruction set that dates back to the 16-bit 8086, while anything 32-bit from the i386 onwards is called **IA-32**.\n\nbut because some software may need things that only came until newer generations of CPUs, some use the \"fan-made\" x86 numbers in the saga to signify that the software needs at least stuff from that generation, so one can find software to be labeled **i686** as it requires instructions and new components only found in P6 CPUs and newer ones.\n\n# AMD64 on Intel CPUs?\n\nRemember that I said that intel tried to patent i586 to screw competitors? That is becauae Intel was not the only company making x86-compatible CPUs. Other companies were Texas Instruments, Cyrix, WinChip and Advanced Micro Devices. Only the last survives to this day as the sole competitor on the x86 CPU market, now known only for it's initials: **AMD**.\n\nWhen intel came up with Pentium, AMD launched the Am5x86, The Pentium II and III were against the AMD K5 and K6 series, and so on...\n\nBut in the new millennium, AMD took the x86 architecture, and brought it to the 64-bit level. That is why it is called **x86-64**, **x86\\_64**, **AMD64** or sometimes **x64**. The first CPU to sport the new architecture was the AMD Opteron.\n\nIntel then made some cross-licensing agreements so they could make 64-bit CPUs, with the Intel Xeon being the first Intel 64 CPU in 2004.\n\nBecause of limited capabilities (mainly only being able to access 4GB of RAM), support of 32-bit x86 has been phasing out, with the last 32-bit only CPUs made around 2011.\n\n\n\nWith that being said, unless you are trying to revive a Windows XP-era PC that still has a floppy drive and tons of obsolete memory card readers on the front, you most certainly have a computer or laptop with an x86-64 CPU, be either an Intel Pentium, Celeron or Core, or an AMD A-Series, Athlon, Phenom, FX or Ryzen, all of them trace their origins to that i386 that saw the light in the mid 80's.\n\n\n\nMeaning that yes, you can forget about the 32-bit version of that program and use the \"amd64\" version in your Core i9 gaming rig.", "output": "Also one... FUN of trivia is that Intel did come up with a sort of... Odd. Implementation for 64-bit processing called '[Itanium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanium)'.\n\nIt never saw any use in the home or retail market, pretty much being stuck in the higher end server market mostly due to the IA-64 instruction set not being backwards compatible with x86 programs, and being notoriously difficult to program for.\n\nThe main reason I mention it?\n\nSimply because that due to Intel's insistence on this chip/instruction set which had stunted further development on a more openly backwards compatible standard. Which was developed by AMD and called [x86-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64).\n\nSo thanks to AMD, we have processors that can utilize more than 4 gigs of memory, are insanely backwards compatible to a large degree with the older/earlier x86 instruction set, and yet despite AMD's lower market share than Intel, pretty much set the stage for modern computing as we know it.\n\nWhich is nice since I remember buying one of the original AMD Opteron's with 64 bit processing and spending WEEKS getting my hands on a copy Windows XP Profession 64-bit.\n\n... My god that was a mess to run at the time. And now? Seamless.\n\nInsane to think how far technology has come..."}

{"id": "1fgjabt", "instruction": "Thinking of switching? Tips from a user of 26 years.", "input": "I see lots of posts here from people considering switching to Linux. As someone who has used Linux exclusively since '98 I think I'm qualified to list a few pointers:\n\n1. Don't think that you can convert overnight. If your computer is important or is used for critical tasks either use a different one for your initial Linux adventures or at least make backups and install Linux on a separate partition.\n\n2. Don't make it harder than it has to be. I'd bet the majority of people that end up going back to their old OS do so because they made Linux harder than necessary for themselves.\n\n3. Don't try to do it all at once. Just get comfortable with the way Linux works for a start. It's totally different to Windows under the hood but it's also transparent so you can see how it works. Read about it, snoop the filesystem, get familiar with it. Don't worry too much about radical customization or learning 15 programming languages until you feel at home.\n\n4. Don't use a particular distro because it's what the \"cool kids\" use or because it's the flavour of the month. I'm looking at you Arch, and all your bastard offspring. Use a mainstream, mature distro that uses a mainstream, mature packaging system. These kinds of distros also tend to have better forum support. Don't bother replying in defence of Arch or any other niche distros, I don't care what you think.\n\n5. There's nothing worse than a distro that works fine until you go to upgrade or install new software, when you find it craps out because of missing packages or a dependency or an offline repository. Or maybe the repo is up but hasn't been updated. In my not-at-all-humble opinion you should only be considering distros that are either Debian or Red Hat based. The Debian based ones include Ubuntu, Mint, MX and others. The best known RedHat based distro is Fedora. Personally I have always found the Debian distros to be rock solid with zillions of available packages, and the apt based installers to be extremely reliable. With Mint or MX you don't normally have to enable any extra repositories.\n\n6. My recommended choice for a newby is always Mint. Debian based, reliable and solid, very good hardware detection, huge repositories and solid package management. It requires little to no fettling out of the box. MX is also very good and is a little snappier.\n\n7. Don't get sucked into using the fanciest whiz-bang desktop environment you can find for your first installation. Just get something simple like XFCE, Mate or maybe Gnome for a start. Get the feel for Linux first, then you can spend as much time as you like customizing the ultimate desktop.\n\n8. Don't ask for help on Reddit (yes, I know). Go to the forum of your chosen distro, you'll get better advice there. This place is full of snot nosed kids. Google any problems you might encounter; it's almost certain others have had the same problem and have found solutions. I'm gobsmacked by the quantity of questions asked here by people who have obviously spent zero effort on even the most rudimentary web search. Helping yourself is easy.\n\n9. Linux distros are almost trivially easy to download and install. Most can be run from a USB stick. The beauty of this is that you can see if you like a distro and check its hardware detection without having to install it (known as running a live session). If you like it you can generally install it from within a live session. A handy source of info on many many distros is the distrowatch web site. There are lots of info there on many different distros but remember point 4: avoid the obscure distros.\n\n10. For the first few months at least, treat your Linux partition as experimental. In other words don't use it to store important stuff. Sometimes the first distro you try doesn't quite do everything you want so don't be shy about trying something different. Besides it's fun to see how other distros do things. When you are satisfied with your distro and desktop environment then you can make it your everyday workhorse.\n\nThat'll do for now.", "output": "Good post.  I’d add, before you actually install Linux make a list of the programs you use in Windows and see if Linux versions exist or if similar programs exist so you can have a conversion plan.   I also took notes on all the tweaks I had to do to get something to work so it was easy to reproduce after a rebuild (and I did a lot of rebuilds).  I used the web version of OneNote so the notes were available over rebuilds. Use a password manager like Bitwarden so you always have access to your passwords across rebuilds.  Finally, I got a Firefox account so my bookmarks would synch so every time I did a rebuild I had all my links to the pages with a solution to issue I had to overcome.  For example, I had to figure out how to get xbindkeys to work so, once I figured it out I wrote  down the h file info so it would be easy to set up the next time."}

Sometimes we are able to help them recover that data, but an ounce of prevention and all that.\n\n**What should you back up?**\n\nYou should have backups of any data that A) is useful to you and B) can't be reliably replaced (rescanned, re-downloaded, or get a copy from uncle JimmyJoBob).\n\n**What if I don't back up?**\n\nStatistically speaking, you *will* eventually lose something that can't be replaced.  Family photos, your thesis, the notes from that meeting, the song you recorded with your dad.  It's just a matter of when, what, and how much you lose due to a drive failure, fire, flood, or theft.\n\n**How do I back up?**\n\nThe first rule is 3-2-1.  Tried and true.  You should have at least 3 copies of your data, on 2 different media, at least 1 of which is stored offsite from your computer.\n\n**Three copies.**  That's pretty easy.  You want three copies of the file.\n\n**Two different media.**  That's a little more complicated.  Having two copies of the data on the same hard drive (same media) is NOT a backup.  If the single drive fails, you've lost both copies.  Likewise, having two copies in the same email account (same media) is NOT a backup.  If that email service craps out, you've lost both copies.\n\nThe idea is that you don't want a single failure to wipe out both copies.  Another example of \"not a backup\" is RAID.  RAID arrays are \"fault tolerant\" in that they can survive some drive problems / failures, but fault tolerance is NOT considered having an additional copy of the data and doesn't count as a backup.\n\nSo for \"different media\" we really mean that if your original is on your hard drive, then your backups should NOT be on that hard drive.  They should be on a cloud storage, removable media, NAS, etc that is not a permanent part of your computer.\n\n**At least ONE offsite.**  This one is key.  If you have 500 copies of your critical files, stored on 500 different media, but they are all at your home/office... well what if the house burns down or floods?  What if someone steals it all?  These things can happen.  So at least ONE of those copies should be offsite.  This could include remote cloud storage, a remote server, or even a hard drive that you store somewhere far from your computer (home, office, or bank lock box, etc).\n\nSo let's make this easy.  Assuming your critical photos / documents / etc, are on your computer's hard drive, what's a decent strategy?\n\nCopy 1:  Local HDD.  Duh.\n\nCopy 2:  Remote storage.  For this, I recommend using a FOSS option like Nextcloud, duplicity, rdiff-backup, borgbackup, rsync coupled with a remote server you own / have access to, or a proprietary program such as Crashplan, SpiderOak, Carbonite.  I believe that these can all be configured to do incremental backups at set times, near-real-time backups, and versioning. [Thanks to /u/overtmind for FOSS examples]\n\nAnother key point here:  A real-time sync is NOT a remote backup **if** it doesn't have versioning.  That is, if deleting the local file also deletes the remote file in real-time, and there is not way to get an older archived version of the file, **that is not a backup**.  \n\nCopy 3:  For this, since we've already satsified the off-site aspect, we can just do a second copy on a local NAS, removable media (HDD/DVD/USB).  This allows fast recovery if something as mundane as a local file corruption or primary HDD crash happens.\n\nOkay, NOW you have backups.  You know what else is not a backup?  One that hasn't been tested.  If you haven't tested your ability to recover data from a backup, **you have no verified backup**.\n\nHow do you test this?  Easy enough.  Back up some trivial data you don't care about to all three locations from time to time.  Then delete it from your primary drive.\n\nNow, and this is critical, **wait a reasonable amount of time**.  Think about how long it might be before you realize that a file you needed has been corrupted or is missing.  A few hours?  A few days?  You want your test to mimic that scenario as much as reasonably possible.\n\nNow try to recover a copy from **each** of your backups.  If you can do so, you are golden. If not, then one or more of your backup locations is not reliable and should be replaced or fixed.\n\nI hope folks found this useful.  There's nothing more heartbreaking than hearing a friend or relative tell you how they lost years of photos, scanned documents, or other irreplaceable 0s and 1s.

Often they'll have a video because it's easier to show a GUI in action than to describe the step by step clicking that you need to do. Now, it's so much more complicated with Linux because there are so many different Desktop Environments and an infinite number of ways to configure them. This makes extremely difficult (if not virtually impossible) to describe to someone a click-by-click GUI method of fixing a lot of problems.\n\nConversely, most Linux issues can be easily solved by a few fairly universal terminal commands. These commands can be cut and paste into the terminal quickly with very little extra explaination; no long drawn out video or explaination necessary. Most terminal commands are Desktop Environment agnostic and will work regardless of the GUI setup. \n\nA good example is installing software and a PPA in Ubuntu and its derivatives: It's much easier to give a couple of apt commands to add the repository, update the sources cache, and install the software. Explaining the GUI method would be tremendously complex and differ greatly from Gnome to Cinnamon to KDE so much as to be useless."}

{"id": "abk8bw", "instruction": "What do bootable USB makers like Rufus actually do?", "input": "I know that they take an ISO image and put it on your USB so that it (somehow) is bootable. Is there any special process that is happening here? What is Rufus actually *doing*?", "output": "(Obligatory: Thank you very much for the gold, kind stranger!)\n\n[PART 1]\n\nRufus developer here. Glad you asked, because a lot of people seem to think an utility like Rufus doesn't do much (_\"Why use Rufus when you can just use `diskpart`?\"_), and fail to realize that there is usually a lot more happening behind the scenes because of all the many __quirks__ that are inherent to what can mostly be described as trying to fit a round peg (an ISO image) into a __smaller__ square hole (a USB drive).\n\nSo, what does Rufus do. Well, that varies a lot depending on the type of source image you have and type of computer you are trying to boot.\n\n* If the source is a DD (pure disk image) or ISOHybrid image (mixed ISO and disk image), then this is the simplest case: Rufus does write it, bit for bit, without any conversion, onto the USB drive... except (__quirk #1__) it also first needs makes sure that there doesn't exist another process that is currently trying to access the drive in write mode, since, to __reliably__ write to the drive, you really don't want to leave the door open for something else to also have kept some write access opened, as there is no telling how they might arbitrarily change the data you just wrote behind your back, and screw up the boot. Also, you may have to work around some Windows own quirks (__quirk #2__, mostly seen with Windows 10), where Windows will prevent you to write whatever you want unless you first cleared the drive properly (and by properly, Microsoft means using one of the 3 methods that are supposed to clear the partition tables and whatnot, but that are temperamental enough so that only one tends to work as expected). Now, once you managed to clear the drive, write the data, and made sure that nothing should have been able to modify it behind your back, then you \"should\" be able to rely on the makers of the image to have sorted the USB boot, so your job is done (or at least, if it doesn't work, it's not your issue).\n\nHowever, not all ISOs are ISOHybrids. Especially the Windows ISOs aren't, so the method above, which we call \"DD Mode\", cannot be applied all the time. Besides, DD writing presents major drawbacks for Windows users in that the image may be written using a file system that Windows does not support, in which case many people are going to be confused as to why they are no longer able to see or access the content of their USB in File Explorer, or, in case the image contains an EFI System Partition, why they suddenly only see a super small FAT32 partition with next to no content, from what used to be a large USB... And even if the image does use a file system / partition mapping (remember, Windows version prior to Win10 1703 could not mount more than one partition from a drive with the \"removable\" attribute, which most USB Flash Drives will have) that lets users access the data from Windows, by writing in DD Mode, you are only ever going to be able to use your drive up to the maximum size of the original image. In other words, this means that if the people who created a DD/ISOHybrid image used a 4GB image, then, if it gets copied on a 32GB drive, there's going to be 28GB of data that you can't use at all, until you repartition and reformat your drive, which of course isn't ideal... And I'm not even going to comment on how ISOHybrid is a major hack in the first place, by trying to combine two completely different file systems do stuff they were never designed to do, with all the problems that can ensue (which is why it's very unlikely you're ever going to see ISOHybrid versions of Windows ISOs. But then again, who knows...). For the record, __this__ is the reason you can't use Etcher to write a Windows ISO to an USB drive because Etcher can only cope with DD or ISOHybrid images. Despite what many people seem to believe, because it has become the norm to use it on recent popular Linux distros, ISOHybrid is the __exception__ rather than the norm, so if you only support \"DD Mode\", you're going to be stuck at some stage...\n\nSo, what do you do when you don't have a DD or ISOHybrid image. Well, that is where things start to get a lot more \"interesting\".\n\n* A lot of people seem to think that, if that ISO is UEFI compatible, then it's about as easy as writing a DD image, in that you simply need to copy the content of the ISO onto a FAT32 formatted partition, and you're good to go... Except you may have a file on that ISO that is larger than 4 GB (For instance __ALL__ of the recent retail versions of the Windows 10 1809 are like that), in which case you can't use FAT32 (file system design limits the maximum size of a single file to 4GB or less), and you need to apply some workaround to boot from NTFS. So Rufus does detect that and applies the relevant quirk appropriately (__quirk #3__). Also, and it turns out that some Linux distros, such as Mandriva (which I'm calling out, because I have opened a bug with them on this for more than 6 months now, and despite repeated requests for updates, they have yet to acknowledge it), have drunk a bit too much of the ISOHybrid Kool-aid, and decided to __remove__ the FAT32 file system driver from their custom GRUB bootloader, which of course wrecks havoc for the boot process of unsuspecting users... And that's not even mentioning some of the Debian derivatives' ISOHybrids that don't bother having the UEFI bootloaders present on the ISO file system, so that they will get copied automatically if you duplicate the ISO content, but instead cram them into a virtual `efi.img` FAT image. So (__quirk #4__), Rufus must also extract the `efi.img` content so that, if you use ISO Mode and not DD Mode, the resulting drive should still boot. Oh, and then there's Windows 7, which is UEFI compatible (at least for the x64 version), but __only__ after you rename/copy the relevant EFI loader in the right place (__quirk #5__). Still, converting an UEFI bootable ISO to UEFI bootable USB is actually pretty straight forward (provided the people who created the ISO made sure their content could be booted in Hard Disk mode from a FAT32 or NTFS file system)..."}

So here goes...\n\n# Backstory\n\nI'm in the middle of distro-hopping. I tried Mint and didn't care for it much. I can't really put my finger on why I didn't like it...it just didn't click. I then went to Ubuntu and, while it was better, I ended up having a fairly large problem where I couldn't burn CDs/DVDs at all. Trying to research that problem ultimately lead me to believe that it was caused by Mercury in retrograde or something because there was absolutely no one else that seemed to have the problem I was having (I ended up buying a new burner which worked). In both of these distributions, however, installation was a breeze. I was able to connect to wifi right out of the box and everything was hunky-dory. I brazenly took this for granted and just assumed that all distributions would work this way...\n\nI was so young and naive back then...\n\nAfter that CD/DVD debacle, I decided it was time to move on from Ubuntu and try Fedora. And then...\n\n# The Problem\n\nBroadcom wireless network adapters are apparently notorious for not working with Linux. Their drivers are proprietary and, apparently for moral reasons, most Linux distributions won't ship with some of their drivers \"out of the box.\" Not all Broadcom adapters, mind you. Just a select few. You can (and should) search the internet for your specific network adapter to determine compatibility before installing Linux. Lesson learned there! I searched after the fact and came across [this list](https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/b43#Supported_devices). Turns out, my network adapter, BCM4360, is pretty firmly in the \"not supported\" column. That was fun to discover *after* I already installed Fedora.\n\n# Problem-Solving Efforts\n\nOff to the internets I went! I scoured forum after forum using every combination of \"Broadcom, BCM4360, Fedora\" I could think of. Most solutions involved connecting your computer to the internet, downloading some community-created drivers, and installing them yourself. The irony of having to connect to the internet to install drivers which would allow you to connect to the internet was not lost on me by any means. This is where I got to learn the joys of dependencies...\n\nI set up my internet-connected laptop right next to my \"involuntarily air-gapped\" desktop and got to work. From the laptop, I downloaded an RPM package which allegedly had the right drivers, copied it to a USB drive, plugged that drive into my desktop, copied the RPM file over, and tried to install it - only to have it fail because I needed to install another RPM file first. So I went back to the laptop, downloaded the other RPM file, copied it over, tried to install it...and it failed again because - yup - needed I other files first. Wash-rinse-repeat.\n\nI think I was 4 RPM dependents in before I gave up on Fedora. OpenSUSE was the next distro on my list to try, so I did a quick search to make sure Broadcom drivers were included. That's when I came across this little gem from opensuse-guide.org:\n\n>The Linux kernel comes with the brcm80211 driver by default... If you experience problems with the above driver...you may want to try installing the proprietary broadcom-wl driver (package: *broadcom-wl*) available in the Packman software repository.\n\nWell I took that to mean that, like Ubuntu, it wasn't available \"by default\" *but* it was just a checkbox away, so I didn't worry about it.\n\nWRONG!\n\nTurns out that, like Fedora, the drivers were nowhere to be found. Back to the RPMs.\n\n# The False-Hope Solution\n\nFortunately, the OpenSUSE community seemed to be more helpful than the Fedora community in terms of developing and distributing the necessary drivers. Finding the right RPM files went much faster. And, unlike Fedora, there were apparently only two that I needed ([here's the link](https://software.opensuse.org/package/broadcom-wl) to one of them - I can't remember where the other one is, but you should be able to find it quickly on the same website once you know what dependent you need). But then...probably just out of spite...I found that these files were created by M. C. Esher. You see...RPM #2 was a dependent of RPM #1 ***but*** RPM #1 was also a dependent of RPM #2. Damn! But then I remembered something I saw on a forum back when I was dealing with this in Fedora: instead of installing the RPMs one at a time, I should be able to just type:\n\n`sudo rpm -ivh *.rpm`\n\nAnd the system should install *all* RPMs in the directory together. Well wouldn't you know it - it worked! At least...they installed. Still no internet. \"Maybe I just need to reboot,\" I thought to myself. So I did and voila! It found my Broadcom network card! I was saved! Except...I couldn't connect to wifi.\n\nThis was it. This was my low-point. I had two tabs open on my laptop. One of them searching for some last-ditch hope to solve my problem and the other going to Microsoft's website to download an ISO of the Windows 10 installer. I scrolled hopelessly through Google to try and find something - *anything* \\- that might work, but with a heavy sigh, I clicked the dreaded \"2\" button in the search results. But then...then I found something.\n\n# The Real Solution!\n\nI found [a thread](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/cannot-setup-wifi-in-opensuse-leap-42-3-a-4175617838/) with just 5 posts on it. The u/jradio610 of a couple days ago would have just ignored it and moved on. But desperate times called for desperate measures. The fourth post of this thread stated that the OP had fixed their problem with the command:\n\n`sudo mkinitrd`\n\nNow, I know enough to know you don't just go around typing random commands into the terminal - especially when prefixed with sudo. And a quick search for mkinitrd just said that the command \"creates initial ramdisk images for preloading modules\" which might as well have said that it \"configures the flux capacitor for maximizing kilohenry output.\" But again, desperate times. Besides...what's the worst that could happen? If I bricked my system, I would just reinstall Windows. All my data was backed up and offsite, so I had nothing to lose. I pulled up a terminal, typed in the command, hit enter, and rebooted.\n\nAnd it fucking worked.", "output": "i bet you also read lots of stack overflow posts where the OP was like \"guys i fixed it!!!!!!\" then like a month later you see a comment saying \"well what did you do?!\" and the last edit was four years ago. i bet you hated reading those right :D?"}

And occasionally I find new things I need to memorize.\n\nWith that being said, I am hoping that more and more Linux tasks get pulled out of the CLI and get put into nice GUI apps.

Turns out this is a great daily workout for my brain and helps keep me sharp.\n\nLOL!  Linux is a good way to keep an old guy's mind active -- problem solving always is -- but I'm not convinced that \"make geezers remember more stuff\" is *necessarily* a design goal or selling point.\n\nI'm 77 and have been using Windows and Linux in parallel on side-by-side computers for close to two decades.  I want the operating systems I use to work to be as \"no fuss, no muss, no thrills, no chills\" as possible -- stay out of my way and let me focus on the document I'm writing or whatever I'm working on at the moment.  I use Ubuntu as my workhorse because Ubuntu, which has served me well over the years, does that for the most part.\n\nBut I do appreciate your point.\n\nDuring COVID, a group of retired friends, all of us in our 70's, got bored out of our minds and started a \"distro of the month club\".  We pick a distribution every month or so, install it bare metal on test machines, use it for three weeks, and then compare notes about the distribution, evaluating the distribution in general and in terms of our own use case.  Over the last few years, we've looked at several dozen distributions.\n\nI've enjoyed exploring the variety of design approaches to Linux exhibited by the different distributions, but I've become very aware of how quirky many of the distributions actually are, and how difficult it can be to get any given distribution to \"no fuss, no muss, no thrills, no chills\" state, and keep it in that state.\n\nYesterday, I spent a few hours installing LMDE, setting it up for my use case.  As distributions go, LMDE (LM wedded to a Debian base as a possible future rebase of LM from Ubuntu) was easy to install and more-or-less \"no fuss, no muss\", but I ran into all sorts of minor glitches (for example, getting the mouse to stop twitching running Red Alert 2 on Steam) that I'll probably be able to resolve over the weekend.  I'm sure that I'll run into other stuff as I start using LMDE in earnest over the next few weeks.  Not a big deal, but typical.\n\nI would very much like to see at least the \"*ordinary-user-oriented\"* distributions become entirely GUI and reasonably mindless.  To my mind, we can do that without abandoning more complex design approaches for Linux users who want a more complex working environment.  Linux isn't a monolith."}

I will get to that.\n\nDoing some research and deciding to dive back into the somewhat familiar, I installed the latest Ubuntu and the latest Fedora Desktop on a multiboot USB and took them for a spin. A lot has changed with Ubuntu, some stuff I like, other things, not so much. Gnome has really changed, too. I used it on Fedora for an afternoon and at the end of that session, liking the feel and look of the distribution, went, \"fuck it\".\n\nThis morning, I installed Fedora on my main drive, completely wiping the WIndows 10 install previously housed in it. After install, I ended up applying updates, and then... I decided to install Steam.  I have read about Proton and how far this has come. I have pretty aggressive system specs (or so I think, see below). I knew what I was getting into.\n\nI followed directions on one website to get Proton working and decided to install Cyberpunk 2077 from scratch. I have been playing this game since launch so I am quite familiar with it. I waited for it to finish downloading and when I got the notice that the game was ready to launch, I thought to myself, \"no fucking way this is going to work...\". I am running an AMD GPU, no additional drivers needed or so I read, with an AMD CPU. This means that other than installing Steam, enabling Proton, and installing the game I did no tweaking--as barebones as it gets.\n\nI launch the game.\n\nNot a glitch. Not one fucking glitch.

As the support for Windows 7 is running out, all my family admin PCs get now the Linux treatment - If anybody is going to Windows 10 they are on their own, or need to get a different \"administrator\".\n\nSo I sometimes get some old and cheap consumer hardware to support. One was a Brother DCP-195C a several year old printer/scanner and as \"consumer\" as one gets. Unluckily it is not supported via the kernel... So I had to install the driver manually.

{"id": "vv6bcp", "instruction": "My Friend Switched to Fedora. Here's How it Went.", "input": "I decided to turn my friend on to Fedora 36 WS a bit ago because her experience with Windows 10 was beginning to cripple her laptop with bloatware, random stuff running in the background, intrusive updates, etc. Her SSD was also totally full, and we decided a full wipe wouldn't hurt considering it wasn't full of anything useful. So we proceeded. First, the good:\n\n* She loved GNOME. I know a big portion of talk on here about Linux DEs surrounds how familiar Windows users will be with them, but her transition to GNOME was flawless & she really enjoyed using it because she preferred it aesthetically to Windows.\n* GNOME Software, despite its bugs, was great. She agrees that downloading installers from websites is clunky, & having a package manager was great. I remember my first experience using a Package Manager, and thinking, \"Why doesn't everyone else do it this way?\"\n* Everything worked perfectly, no system slowness, no bugs, nothing went catastrophically wrong. Every app she wanted to use except one (Roblox, unavailable on Linux) was a smooth experience.\n* Minecraft ran far better. Kind of an aside, but cool nonetheless.\n\nNow, the bad:\n\n* She never once updated. Everything was out of date because she was never FORCED to update, so she never did. I know the more technologically inclined among us may see the gentle update system on Linux as respectful & superior, but I think this is something to think about.\n* Nobody around her uses Linux, & she can't just call a company for support. She can't ask anyone but me if she has any issues. Despite my urging that she probably won't have any problems, I understand the looming idea that *something* might happen is important to think about.\n* Roblox. Enough to tip her over the edge to switch back to Windows 10. Grapejuice & WINE are not seamless enough with the average user to be considered as a solution, and for the life of me I cannot even get it to work.\n* Multiple versions of packages in the store are confusing. Say what you will about Flatpak, but Flathub apps are updated regularly (when the user updates them :P) & distro-agnostic, and personally I consider Flatpak package management to be pretty newb-friendly.\n* She has a 4k laptop display connected to a 1080p monitor. Sometimes there were weird situations moving windows back and forth that caused things to act unexpectedly. I think this is a more well-known issue.\n\nI can't say there's a takeaway, but she's switching back to Windows 10 in spite of the knowledge that her Linux experience was faster, smoother, seamless, & low-maintenance. Maybe Fedora was the wrong choice for a beginner, but I thought it worked out well enough. I think if the Linux world is going to create a real newb-focused distro, we will have to make some concessions & implement features that we ourselves may not enjoy using in the slightest. Like forced updates, or stripping the Software Center of different kinds of packages. But that's just me, I am uncertain what others think & you guys may have a different take.\n\nAlthough I feel discouraged, I understand that there were a lot of wins here & Linux is VERY close to being 100% beginner-friendly. I'd give the experience a B+ in the end.

Again I want to thank all of you who supported a post and will update it with many of your suggestions today or tomorrow. <3**\n\nHey there, it's UniqUnic here again and I'm bringing you a guide on useful Linux software you probably haven't heard of. Big thanks to contributors : | [u/fedeb95](https://www.reddit.com/user/fedeb95/) | [u/JaZoray](https://www.reddit.com/user/JaZoray/) | [u/lionblaze55](https://www.reddit.com/user/lionblaze55/) | [u/TheBravePoro](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheBravePoro/) | [u/drelos](https://www.reddit.com/user/drelos/) | [u/jhereg10](https://www.reddit.com/user/jhereg10/) | [u/clichedname](https://www.reddit.com/user/clichedname/) | [u/greginnj](https://www.reddit.com/user/greginnj/) | [u/venomspinner](https://www.reddit.com/user/venomspinner/) | [u/Illithilitch](https://www.reddit.com/user/Illithilitch/) | [u/ask2sk](https://www.reddit.com/user/ask2sk/) |\n\n# Useful Linux apps you probably haven’t heard about\n\nA  while ago, I joined many Linux communities. Unlike on Windows ones,  people usually mentioned apps and software, that many of us have heard  of. These sequences of answers came across my email, repeatedly every  once or twice a week. It started to get strange how people didn’t  discover many software available in repositories so today I’m bringing  you useful apps and software **for Linux** you probably haven’t heard of.\n\n## Pixeluvo\n\nPixeluvo  is an image manipulation tool available for Windows and Linux. It packs  many powerful tools which are included in Photoshop and on top of them  adds premade Instagram like filters except these have more of control  options. Many of you may say that GIMP has already made Linux users a  favor by packing most of Photoshop features, but if you are more of an  amateur who does like touched up photos, but doesn’t like spending much  time on it, this is a perfect choice for you.\n\n## Shutter\n\nShutter  is a free and easy to use app for taking screenshots of your Linux  desktop. It has a user friendly interface it is perfect choice for  people who like taking shots of certain parts of pages. It can also  automatically select certain windows and elements of documents, web  pages or books. Shutter is one of the most powerful and lightweight apps  for this purpose.\n\n## CrococryptFile\n\nCrococrypt  is one simplest encryption tools but at the same time rich in features  you will most likely need. It covers many encryption suites such as :  password-based, PGP-based, AES-256 based etc. Crococrypt is also easy to  use and has a flat style interface without any confusing info, average  users won’t need. It also includes its own file type called .croco.\n\n## Epiphany\n\nNow  this one is a bit more popular than others on this list, but at the  same time worth mentioning. This is a web browser which is basically  Safari for Mac OS. It is lightweight, fast and secure and doesn’t pack  nearly any extensions. If you’ve ever wondered of great Linux browser,  that will allow you to browse internet freely, without browser  collecting info about your computer, well this is option you should go  for.\n\n## Soundnode\n\nHaven’t  heard of SoundCloud? Well you’re probably living in 1900s. Many of  SoundCloud users have probably tried to find a desktop app, which allows  you to use all of its functionalities, well it is pretty hard. Luckily  there is a project going around which tends to allow Linux users to use  SoundCloud as an actual app, and its name is Soundnode. It has a nice  and clean dark user interface which is easy to navigate. Even though it  doesn’t have all of the functionalities SoundCloud Web App has, it can  handle most of your daily tasks you throw at it.\n\n## MPC-HC\n\nThis  one is more of Windows exclusive app, but Wine handles it almost  perfectly. MPC-HC is a media player which uses Codecs that are the  opposite of ones that VLC uses. MPC is by far the best media player you  can find. It supports many file types and colors are the closest result  to the original you can get. After a bit of testing you’ll realize that  VLC tends to produce warmer colors.\n\n## LMMS\n\nEver  heard of Fruity Loops Studio? Well LMMS is trying to produce the same  result as FL Studio when it comes to making beats. With nineteen built  in instruments, you’ll be able to produce beats like never before. It  also includes some audio editing features like different charts,  equalization and normalization and there are plenty of plugins as it is  open source. It also includes FX Mixer, Keyboard (PC or Midi) support  and some sound effects like Kick, Clap, Snare etc.\n\n## Ramme\n\nLove  Instagram? Well this is a perfect solution for you. Ramme is an app  which packs all of the Instagram features into one desktop app. It  supports two themes which are preinstalled, but you can customize their  code so they look different with a little programming knowledge. Ramme  is specifically know for its keyboard shortcuts and there are plenty of  those. Unfortunately Ramme is no longer maintained.\n\n## GPaste\n\nHave  you ever copied the URL of your MP3 converter site, closed a page and  than copied YouTube song URL. In that case you must be wondering, “Why  the hell did I do this ?”. Well there comes GPaste, a clipboard manager.  It can shorten your links with a little bit of tweaking and includes  settings for auto clearing history, saving data types and many more.  GPaste was specifically designed for Gnome3 but will work on many other  environments.\n\n## RawTherapee\n\nRawThreapee  is another Gnome image manipulation software, but completely different  from Pixeluvo. It is more like Lightroom for Linux. It packs many tools  and algorithms such as : demosaicing algorithms, hue and saturation,  white balance, exposure etc. It also supports RAW files just like  Lightroom and they both have similar interfaces.\n\n## Angry Search\n\nIf  you’ve ever been using Windows, you would have heard of Search  Everything which is a great app. It stores data about your computer into  one file and than finds it easily. Well here’s a Linux app for that. It  also has many modes. Some show less, some show more info about files.  It also includes Hex search which is great.\n\n## Flame Shot\n\nFlame  Shot is another app for taking screenshots, but this one has really  nice interface with some features you won’t find in many other programs.  It includes manual delay settings, full screen or cropped captures,  markers, shapes, different colors, arrows etc. This app can be launched  both in GUI or without it.\n\n## Etcher\n\nEtcher  is a USB flashing tool. This is yet simple, but useful tool. It  includes simple interface with just a few buttons which is beautiful. It  claims to be faster about 50% that others, but actually you can’t be  sure. In some of my tests it was 70–72% faster than UNetBootin, whereas  in the others it was only 10–15% faster. It really depends on which file  you’re trying to flash. One thing which is outstanding it that it  recognizes hard drives, both internal and external. This way you can be  sure it won’t wipe your data.\n\n## PacVim\n\nIf  you want to be a good programmer or developer, you are probably wanting  to switch to Vim. You might be wondering : “Well, it’s just another  text editor, isn’t it ?”. Well the answer is “No”. Because of its wide  language support and features it packs, it is quite hard to use and  understand for newbies, that’s where PacVim jumps in. PacVim is a game  which will teach you Vim commands. How do we achieve results? Simple,  ever played Pac-Man, well you are a green cursor (Pac-Man) who tries to  avoid red letter ‘G’, while attempting to highlight words.\n\n## Devils pie\n\nDevils  pie is another simple tool, which may help all of the multitaskers. It  allows you to set on which workspace will application open, what size  and in which state, when you click on its shortcut. Yup, simple as that.\n\n## Rofi\n\nRofi  is a text based, programmable launcher. Rofi includes text interface  which will greet you with a set of commands which are stored in some  kind of folders. It includes many themes and supports UTF-8 and RTL.  Stuff it can do includes : Windows Launcher, Application Launcher, SSH  Launcher, DMenu replacement etc. It has fully configurable keyboard  navigation as well.\n\n## PDFUnite\n\nPDFUnite  is an application, which is ran in command line, where it ask you for  inputs of PDF file locations. After it gets locations, it merges them  into a single PDF… Well… That’s it :)\n\n## Radio Tray\n\nRadio  Tray is as its name suggests, program for for listening to radio. It  comes with a list of radio stations preconfigured but it’s also  extremely easy to add your own. You simply need the radio station URL  (quick search is usually all it takes) and then you click “configure  radios” to add it. The GUI is super neat and tidy and it lives in the  system tray on cinnamon beside the clock and other little applets. It is  far more superior than TuneIn radio which people usually recommend,  there are no ads, no clutter, nothing. Just a clean icon and a click.\n\n## TimeShift\n\nTimeShift  usually comes perinstalled nowadays, but in some distributions it can  come handy. It is an app for creating system restore points, and  restoring back to them. It automatically takes snapshots of file system  at regular intervals. Keep in mind that this app is completely different  from other system restore point apps. Its goal is not restoring user  files, but restoring only file system.\n\n## PEEK\n\nPEEK  is another simple but really great tool for all bloggers who make  HowTo’s on their computer or in those situations when you are sending a  bug report (it’s 2018 who does that ?). This app has a simple user  interface which is not much adjustable, but does the job. It supports  three file types : GIF, MP4 and WebM. You can also disable mouse clicks  and cursor. Keep in mind that GIF won’t work well without gifski codec.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWell,  if you’ve come to the end of this article I hope you enjoyed.

Been doing the distro/DE hopping thing.  I learned a lot about Linux installing and using Arch as my daily driver at home.\n\nI settled on Pop!_OS because I will be buying a laptop from S76 and they seemed to be very stable and easy to use (even for someone who came from Arch).\n\nI can now use it as my personal daily, but I wanted to see if I can work as a System Administrator in a mostly Windows shop (though we have other tech like VMWare and NetApp).  However, I didn't want to join the domain with Pop!_OS.  I found out I could do almost everything.\n\n1. Remmina helps a lot with RDP duties.  However, if you need to access outside the organization (going through RDGW and RDCB), Remmina is not very happy with that.  I just can't connect at all this way.  Even when trying to use the resulting RDP file from the RD Web portal.\n\n2. NetApp and VMWare are all administered via the web browser, so all is good in that land.  I even used Microsoft Edge to separate my work bookmarks from my personal stuff in Firefox.  Even VMWare's Remote Console is available for Debian based distros (DEB file), so it was easy to install via Eddy.  I can't imaging what I have to go through with Arch and AUR.\n\n3. DisplayLink - I have 4 monitors at work.  3 supported by the docking station, so the 4th monitor have to use a USB3 to DisplayLink adapter.  I couldn't get it working on Arch, but Pop!_OS just needed me to download and install the DisplayLink driver from their website.  It was specifically for Debian or Ubuntu-based distros with easy instructions.\n\n4. Having to rely on Outlook sucks, but their online version isn't too bad.  One Drive isn't automated since I just use the web version.  I'm not interested in syncing folders right now.\n\n5. Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and RingCentral - we use these for communication, and all 3 has Linux-specific apps.  Zoom and Teams were already in Pop Shop (and also in most distro package manager), but RingCentral I had to download from the website (also installs easy).  Again, not sure if I could have made it work in Arch.\n\n6. I also found that our central firewall management software has a native Linux version (Java-based).  It feels clunkier than the Windows version (which already feels clunky), but it worked.\n\n7. Printing - much harder than I thought.  Gnome seem to just display everything that's on the network, so i had a hard time finding the right printer to set up.  After many trial and error, I found it and made it my default printer.\n\n8. I'm tasked to edit a large PDF file (adding or removing pages), and in Windows, I use PDF Rider (and FoxIt Reader to add some small amount of text).  I found FoxIt Reader to be available for Linux as well (had to download from site, not found in Pop Shop), but there are so many PDF editing software that lets you delete, move, and replace PDF pages I literally just chose the top one and it worked great!\n\nI booted into Pop!_OS and figured if I ran into any I can just go into Windows, but the entire day I was just finding Linux alternatives to do my job.  I was productive, and I was excited it was done in Linux.\n\nUpdate: wow I didn't think this post would get this much attention, lol.

We will be using and learning about [Amazon Web Services \\(AWS\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services), [Ubuntu server 16.04](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_\\(operating_system\\)), [Dynamic DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS), and [OpenVPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVPN).\n\n This tutorial will cover:\n\n* What is AWS and what are [EC2 instances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud)\n* How to to configure a virtual headless Ubuntu 16.04 server on AWS's [free hosting tier.](https://aws.amazon.com/free/faqs/)\n* How to open ports in AWS's virtual firewall\n* How to install and configure OpenVPN server\n* How to configure Dynamic DNS\n* How to install the OpenVPN client \n* Using [vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_\\(text_editor\\)) and  to manually edit the ovpn file to work on Ubuntu as well as other config files\n* How to set aliases in [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_\\(Unix_shell\\))\n* How to configure your [ssh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) preferences\n* and a few other bits\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n* A very basic understanding of how a terminal works.\n* A computer with an internet connection. Preferably Ubuntu or Debian based.\n* An ssh client. (For Windows users see [KiTTY](https://www.fosshub.com/KiTTY.html) - a fork of PuTTY but with more features and is still being updated.)\n* A credit/debit card. Don't worry, you won't be charged (if you stick to the free tier), Amazon uses it to verify your identity.\n* A phone for Amazon to verify you more.\n\n**My Philosophy** (Optional reading)\n\nI love Linux. It is my daily driver and for a living I am a Linux/Windows Sysadmin and desktop support. I do things my way and unless someone can give me a good reason to do it differently, I'm doing it the way I like it because what does it matter how I get from A to B? A lot of Linux purists, particually on the sysadmin side will critize your choice in text editor, choosing GUI over CLI, your desktop environment and anything else. Well, boohoo for them. I use vim, but if you like nano, go ahead and nano away. I like Budgie, but f you like Unity, use Unity. Do it how you like it.\n\nIn this tutorial, I will be demonstrating with vim text editor, but emacs or nano or whatever else will work just as fine. Some of the commands will be a bit different but I am sure you will figure it out. \n\nIf you are unsure about how to use any text editor and want to learn vim, keep reading this tutorial. If you prefer to start off with a more simple, user friendly text editor, [do this nano tutorial first.](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/)\n\n\nOK, lets get started....\n\n\n**AWS and EC2**\n\nAWS (or Amazon Web Services), is a cloud computing platform that offers more than just virtual machine hosting, today we are only going to touch on EC2 which is AWS's main service they provide - virtual machine hosting.\n\nThe free tier gives you more than enough to host a Linux server, however the biggest limitation is that you only get 750 hours free per month. This means you can only run 1 server for free. If people are interested, I can do another tutorial on [lxc and lxd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC) which is akin to virtual instances we run in our Virtual Linux server, essentially extending the amount of servers we can use.\n\n***Steps***\n\n1. [Sign up for AWS here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start), confirm your identity with the phone call and credit card details.\n2. Pat yourself on the back, you have completed the first part!!\n\n**Creating an EC2 Instance: Ubuntu 16.04**\n\nAmazon have made creating EC2 instances super easy. There is no need to go through installers. In the world of cloud computing, this is a waste of time. Instead, you will choose an [AMI - or Amazon Machine Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html).\n\nAn AMI is essentially a vanilla template of a server that is ready to go in miliseconds of creating it. Just choose your variables such as RAM, processing power, storage space etc and you are good to go. It's amazing.\n\n***Steps***\n\n1. Log into AWS and navigate to your EC2 Dashboard.\n2. Under the *create instance* header, choose the blue button *Launch Instance*\n3. On the left hand side, check the box that says *Free Tier Only* (we don't want to spend money!!)\n4. Choose *[Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS \\(HVM\\), SSD Volume Type - ami-965e6bf3](https://i.imgur.com/BO2ZiVK.png)* (*Note: This may have changed, but at the time of writing this, this is the most up to date Ubunutu server available*)\n5. Select the instance type: [t2.micro \\(Free tier eligible\\)](https://i.imgur.com/h4tfeGS.png)\n6. Select *Next: Configure Instance Details* \n7. Leave the defaults and choose *Next: Configure Storage*\n8. [Set the storage amount.](https://i.imgur.com/GcY5yNm.png) At the time of writing this, you get up to 30GB of SSD or Magnetic storage for free. It's recommend to have a minimum of 8 GB (default) and if you are only going to only run one EC2 instance, you may as well jack it up to 30GB).\n9. Click *Next: Add Tags*, click *Next: Configure Security Groups*\n10. We need to open some ports for OpenVPN to work properly. [Configure the settings to look like this](https://i.imgur.com/cpuD48V.png). Feel free to name the group anything you like other than *'default'*\n11. Choose *Review and Launch*\n12. Choose *Launch*\n13. You will be prompted to create a *new key pair*. This consists of a public and private key that are used to securely connect to the new Ubuntu server. Download the private key and **keep it somewhere safe**. We need this file everytime we try to connect to the server via ssh.\n\nCongratualtions, you have configured your first EC2 instace with a headless Ubuntu 16.04 server! It will take a little for AWS to configure everything, but it should become live within a minute or two.\n\nYou can optionally give it a name in the instance list. [I've named my OpenVPN](https://i.imgur.com/ZYuBe2g.png).\n\n**Connecting to the Ubuntu Server**\n\nNow that we have got the AWS stuff sorted we need to connect to our new server. If you are on Linux, (which, since this is /r/linux4noobs you should be...) you can open up a terminal. If you are on Windows, go grab KiTTY.\n\n**Steps for Linux**\n\n1. I recommend moving the private key file to the ~/.ssh/ directory for safe keeping. To do so open up bash and enter the command.\n\n        mv path/to/the/keyfile.pem ~/.ssh/keyfile.pem \nNote: Just replace keyfile.pem with the filename that was downloaded.*\n\n2. Now you need to find the Public DNS name. You can get that from the list of EC2 instances. Mine is [ec2-52-15-68-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com](https://i.imgur.com/ZYuBe2g.png). Be careful though, this will likely change after your server is rebooted/powered off. I will discuss how to resolve this later with DDNS.\n\n3. Connect via ssh using the .pem file to identify yourself, ubuntu as the username and the public DNS as the server address:\n\n        ssh -i ~/.ssh/keyfile.pem ubuntu@ec2-52-15-68-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com\n\n You will be prompted to add this server to the list of known hosts. Type *yes* and hit *enter*.\n\n If you are prompted with: WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE! You need to set the permissions to the keyfile.pem file to only be accessible by yourself. To do so, type the below command and try and ssh in again:\n\n         chmod 700 ~/.ssh/keyfile.pem \n\n**Updates**\n\nNow we are in our server, first thing is first. We need to update it. Very easy, just enter the command:\n\n    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\n\n>**What does this do**\n>\n>**sudo** Run as super user \n>\n>**apt** call the [advanced package tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_\\(Debian\\)).\n>\n>**update** tells **apt** to update the list of software that can be installed \n>\n> **&&** joins to commands together\n>\n>**upgrade** tells **apt** to upgrade the OS and any installed software\n>\n>**-y** automatically accepts any prompts.\n\nYou will also likely get a purple screen stating *Configuring grub-pc*, just choose **keep the local version currently installed**\n\nCongratulations we now have an up-to-date Ubuntu server!\n\n**Configuring the Hostname**\n\nBy default the hostname for server should be the IP address which is probably in a 172. address range. You don't need to change the hostname, but if you want to go from Noob-to-Nerd it is good to practice. So, lets use vim to edit the hostname file. vim can be a bit intimidating at first, so feel free to use nano if you prefer but I will walk you through every key stroke.\n\nAll you need to know for now about vim is there are 2 (main) modes. Command mode and insert mode. Command mode allows you to type text commands that manipulate text (e.g. delete line, copy text, search, etc) while insert mode allows you to insert text.\n\nSo in the terminal type:\n\n    sudo vim /etc/hostname\nThis command opens the hostname file in vim with [super user rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo). You will now see the hostname of the server. Mine is *ip-172-31-17-240*. We want to remove this and add out own host name so we need to delete the current text with a command. To do this is easy, by default you are in command mode. To enter a command you simply just type. Now enter the command:\n\n    dd\n'dd' means delete line. After entering this command, the file should now be empty, ready for us to input text. To enter INSERT mode, enter the command:\n\n    i\nNow you can type in the host name you want to name your Ubuntu Server. You can call it anything you like. I am naming mine *OpenVPN*\n\nOnce you enter your hostname it should [look like this](https://i.imgur.com/dk6bF9F.png).\n\nTo exit insert mode press the **ESC** key.\n\nTo save and exit, type the command:\n\n    :wq!\n\nHit **ENTER**\n>Note: Because of historical reasons, some commands require a colon in front of them. The **w** means write (as in write the file), the **q** means quit vim and the **!** means don't prompt for confirmation.\n>\n>If you want to learn more about you can type :help vim-modes\n> \n>You will also notice that there are a lot more modes than the 2 main ones we use)\n\nYou should be returned back to the terminal. To check if you saved the file correctly use the cat command:\n\n    cat /etc/hostname\n\nThe cat command will print out the contents of the file.\n\n\nIt is also a good idea to set the [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_\\(file\\)) to hold its new hostname. To do so we need to open the host file in vim, edit it and save and quit in almost the same way we did above. So type the following:\n\n    sudo vim /etc/hosts\n    o\n    127.0.0.1 [HOSTNAME]\n\nIt should look [similar to this](https://i.imgur.com/kOgvTOC.png). \n\nNow hit the **ESC** key and type\n\n    :wq!\n\nHit **ENTER**\n>Note: **o** inserts a new line below the cursor, **O** inserts a new line above the cursor\n\nAnd dont forget to check it worked.\n\n    cat /etc/hosts\n\n**Optional tools, shortcuts and settings**\n\nI like to add a few things to my Linux setups to make it a bit more flexible and homely. You don't have to do these steps, but it can be good for troubleshooting (when not if the time comes and because some linux commands should be accomplishible in less characters in my opinion.).\n\nSince the free tier of AWS only offers [dynamic internet facing IP addresses and not a static IP address](https://support.google.com/fiber/answer/3547208?hl=en) it can be necessary to find out the external IP address sometimes. The easy way for desktops is to open the browser and Google 'what is my ip', but we don't have a browser so we need to do it with a command, this is where **curl** steps in...\n\n**curl** is great. Its job is to simply transfer data to or from a server. It supports everything - SMB, FTP, HTTP, LDAP, POP3...the list goes on. In this case, we want it to connect to the website ifconfig.me and pull back the external IP address for our server.\n\nTry it out with:\n\n    curl ifconfig.me\n\nIt will return just an external IP address.\n>Note: When you SSH into your server, you can also use ubuntu@[ExternalIPAddress]\n\nThere is one problem if you are lazy like me. That curl command is 16 characters just to get an IP address. That's too much typing. Lets make a shortcut command for this - they are called aliases.\n\nThere is a hidden file in the home directory called the **.bashrc** file. This file customises your terminal envirnoment. One such customisation is setting an alias. You can take a looooooong complex command and rename it to anything you want.\n\n>A colleague of mine types **hulksmash** to run **sudo init 6** (force restart a computer) thanks to aliases.\n\nNow, we can edit the **.bashrc** file like we did above with the **hostname** and **hosts** file, but as I mentioned, I am lazy and opening vim is too much effort. I don't even want to open the file. Let's just append a line to the end of the **.bashrc** file. We want to append the following line:\n\n    alias xip='curl ifconfig.me'\n>**What does this do**\n>\n>**alias** tells bash that an alias to a command now exists\n>\n> **xip** The name of the alias (you can call this anything you want. e.g. **hulksmash**)\n>\n>**curl ifconfig.me** The actual command. (Make sure this is wrapped in single quotes)\n\nWe need to ask our server to say something back to us, but then redirect the output to to the **.bashrc** file.\n\nTo do so type:\n\n     echo \"alias xip='curl ifconfig.me'\" >> ~/.bashrc\n> \n> **What does this do**\n> \n> **echo** print a line to the terminal that is between \"\" (in this instance we are printing the line *alias xip='curl ifconfig.me*\n> \n> **>>** send the **echo** to a file\n>\n> **~/.bashrc** the file we are sending our **echo** to.\n\nNow check it worked:\n\n    cat ~/.bashrc\n\nYou should see the new alias in the file. Let's test it:\n\n    xip\n\n....and nothing. Why? Well we have not reloaded the modified **.bashrc** file to be active. Lets do that:\n\n    source ~/.bashrc\n\nWe should now get our external IP address!\n---\n\nThe other thing I like to add in is a speed test tool. But there is another problem; I'm not just lazy, I am also forgetful - and I can't remember the name of the speed test command line app that I use. We should search to see if it is in the database (aka the repository) of software we can install. Type:\n\n    apt search speedtest\n\nWe should get the output:\n\n    Sorting... Done\n    Full Text Search... Done\n    speedtest-cli/xenial 0.3.4-1 all\n    Command line interface for testing internet bandwidth using speedtest.net\n\nOK, it's called **speedtest-cli**. Let's install it:\n\n    sudo apt install speedtest-cli -y\n\nTo use it is really simple. Just type:\n\n    speedtest\n\nThe output will look like:\n\n    Retrieving speedtest.net configuration...\n    Retrieving speedtest.net server list...\n    Testing from Amazon.com (18.188.174.183)...\n    Selecting best server based on latency...\n    Hosted by RackSquared (Columbus, OH) [2.15 km]: 31.796 ms\n    Testing download speed........................................\n    Download: 177.71 Mbit/s\n    Testing upload speed..................................................\n    Upload: 100.99 Mbit/s\n\nNot bad. I got 477Mbit/s down eariler, but beggards can't be choosers.\n\nAnyway, lets continue with actually getting our OpenVPN server working. We are so close I can taste it!\n\n\n**Installing OpenVPN Server**\n\nNow it's time for the fun stuff. Lets download and configure **OpenVPN** server. \n\nFirstly we are going to use a tool called **wget**, which just stands for *web get* (i.e, download something from the web). The package we are downloading will be the script that sets up **OpenVPN** (There is a manual way of downloading and installing **OpenVPN**, but this is the easiest way. I can go into detail about the manual setup if people are interested.) We also want to put the scripts in a new directory. You can put it anywhere, but I like to keep everything organised under the /srv directory. So enter the commands:\n\n    sudo mkdir /srv/scripts/\n    cd /srv/scripts\n    sudo wget https://git.io/vpn -O openvpn-install.sh\n\n**What does this do**\n>**sudo** run command with super user rights\n>\n>**mkdir** Make a directory (the path to our directory is /srv/scripts)\n>\n>**wget** Web Get. Download a file from the internet\n>\n>**-O** Save the downloaded file as a new filename (in our case the file name is openvpn-install.sh).\n \nNow lets grab our external IP address. You will need to remember this during the installation of **OpenVPN**. \n\nIf you did the optional steps above, just enter:\n\n    xip\n\nIf you skipped the optional steps enter:\n\n    curl ifconfig.me\n\nLet's run the setup script:\n\n    sudo ./openvpn-install.sh\n\nDamn! That didn't work. But why? Well as far as our server is concerned, this script is just a text file. You can't execute a text file. You need to tell the server that you can, infact execute this file. To do this, we will use **chmod** with the **-x** switch. **chmod** changes permissions of files and directories, whilst the **-x** switch tells chmod to make a file exicutable. So enter the command:\n\n    sudo chmod +x openvpn-install.sh\n\nOK, now we can try and run the script again. But I am still feeling lazy, so instead of typing out all command again, we can all our history of commands and run the command again with far less characters typed. Just enter:\n\n    !-2\n>**What does this do**\n>\n>**!** means run a previous command (you can use **!!** to run the last command again and insert more commands to it. If you forget to add **sudo** to the start of a long command, just run **sudo !!** and it will **sudo** the last command you executed).\n>\n>**-2** means run the second last command. **-5** would ran the 5th last command.\n\nYou should be now greeted with:\n    \n    Welcome to this quick OpenVPN \"road warrior\" installer\n    \n    I need to ask you a few questions before starting the setup\n    You can leave the default options and just press enter if you are ok with them\n    \n    First I need to know the IPv4 address of the network interface you want OpenVPN\n    listening to.\n    IP address: 172.31.17.240\n\nKeep the default IP address and hit **ENTER**\n\nYou will be asked if you want  **UDP** or **TCP** connections. [This article](https://support.holmsecurity.com/hc/en-us/articles/212963869-What-is-the-difference-between-TPC-and-UDP-) explains the different transmission types. We will stick with UDP, so enter **1** and hit **ENTER**\n\n\nNow you will prompted to choose a port that OpenVPN will operate on. Remember back in the **Creating an EC2 Instance: Ubuntu 16.04**, [we opened up some ports](https://i.imgur.com/cpuD48V.png) for our server to talk on? Well OpenVPN talks on 1194. You can think of ports as lanes on a freeway that only one type of traffic can go at a time: the fast lane, slow lane, commuter lane, bus lane. But instead of cars we have programs. OpenVPN only can go down lane (or port) 1194, SSH can only go down lane 22 etc. We can tell these programs they can go down other ports, but we don't have too. Keep it the default of 1194 if that is the port that was opened before, or set it to your custom port.\n\n>**Note:** Why do we change ports if we dont have to? Well, sometimes people scan to find open ports that they can attack. Because there are so many ports, these people usually only scan for the default ones. If we change our port from the default to something obscure like changing **OpenVPN** to talk on port 1989 it is less likely someone will find it. This is called *security through obscurity*.\n\nYou will be asked what you want to set your [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) to. Google DNS works fine, [OpenDNS has some extra functionality](https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/) like malware filtering and other bits and peices. I am going to stick with Google.\n\nNow you will be asked about the client certificate. This is a file that authenticates the person connecting to the VPN. You can name this what you like and you can have more than just one. \n>If you do want more than one, re-run the script and you will only be asked for the name for the client certificate. \n\nI am just going to stick with the default *client*\n\nNow press *any key*. \n\nThe script will now go and download **OpenVPN** as well as **easy-rsa** with **apt**, then configure OpenVPN and generate an [RSA key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_\\(cryptosystem\\)) with **easy-rsa**.\n\nNow, remember how we asked about the external IP address? We need to enter it now. If you forgot it, or didn't write it down. You can get it from the instance list in the AWS control panel.\n\nTechnically, that's it. You have a fully functional VPN server, but it is of no use yet. You need to copy the client configuration file. By default it will be found in:\n\n    ~/[YOURCLIENTNAME].ovpn\n\nIn my case, my file is found in:\n\n    ~/client.ovpn\n\nWe will need to use a function [secure copy shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy) (**scp**) to get this down to our local machine. **scp** is based on **ssh** and is very easy to use.\n\nIf your local machine is running linux, we will make a new hidden folder called **.openvpn** in our home directory (**~**)\n\nFirst open a new terminal, one that is for your local machine.\n\nEnter the following command to make a new hidden directory:\n\n    mkdir ~/.openvpn\n>**Note:** a **.** before a directory name makes it hidden\n\nNow let's copy down the client configuration file from our server.\n\nStill in the terminal for our local machine, enter the command:\n\n    scp -i ~/.ssh/keyfile.pem ubuntu@[YOURSERVERSPUBLICIPADDRESS]:/home/ubuntu/[YOURCLIENTNAME].ovpn ~/.openvpn/[YOURCLIENTNAME].ovpn\n>Remember that ~/.ssh/keyfile.pem is where you placed the key to access your AWS Ubuntu server on your local computer.\n\n>**What does this do**\n>**scp** secure copy files from a remote server\n>\n>**-i** tells scp to use the key file to authenicate the connection to the server\n>\n>**ubuntu** The username to use.\n>\n>**@[YOURSERVERSPUBLICIPADDRESS]** The internet facing IP address of our server\n>\n>**:/home/ubuntu/[YOURCLIENTNAME].ovpn** where our file is found on the remote server\n>\n>**~/.openvpn/[YOURCLIENTNAME].ovpn** Where we are saving our file to.\n\nThe output should like something like:\n\n    client.ovpn                         100% 8219     8.0KB/s   00:00\n\nCongratulations! You should now have the OpenVPN client configuration file. Remember where this file is, we will use it later when setting up the OpenVPN client.\n\n**Dynamic DNS with NoIP**\n\nOne issue with AWS is that on the free tier you only get a dynamic IP address. Meaning you only get to borrow and internet address for the time your server is on for. Each time you reboot your server, you will get a new IP address, so after each reboot every time you want to connect to your VPN client you will need to log on to the AWS dashboard, look at the instances, get the IP address, update the client.ovpn file and then connect. In my book, that is waaay to much work. With Dynamic DNS we can tell it to look at an address that automatically gets translated into an IP address.\n\n**Example:**\n\n> **Without Dynamic DNS**\n> \n> My server is on 192.168.0.1 (Yes, this is a private IP address, but it's easy for arguement sake to use this address).\n> \n> My client.ovpn file is set to point to 192.168.0.1\n> \n> I reboot my server. Its IP is now 192.168.0.55\n> \n> I try to connect to my VPN but 192.168.0.1 is not there anymore! damn!\n> \n> **With Dynamic DNS:**\n> \n> My server is on 192.168.0.1\n> \n> My client.ovpn file is set to point to myvpnserver.com\n> \n> myvpnserver.com currently resolves to 192.168.0.1\n> \n> I reboot my server\n> \n> The server address is now 192.168.0.55\n> \n> A small program from No-IP running on my server updates the Dynamic DNS that the new server IP is 192.168.0.55 and that myvpnserver.com should resolve to this new IP.\n> \n> I try and connect to my vpn with myvpnserver.com and BAM! It still works! \n\nSo, let's set this up!\n\nI really like [No-IP](https://www.noip.com/), but there are other providers out there. DynDNS is another company, but they charge now I think. The only draw back with No-IP is they require you to confirm you still want to use your Dynamic DNS every 30 days. Don't worry, they will email you when your time is close to up!\n\nSo, go [sign up for a No-IP account](https://www.noip.com/sign-up).\n\nOnce signed up, create a host name. To do so:\n\n* Click on *Dynamic DNS* on the left side menu\n* Click *Create Hostname*\n* Enter the hostname you want. I am going to use *openvpntutorial*, but you can call it anything you want.\n* Choose the domain name. I use *ddns.net*, but again you can use anything you want.\n* Set the record type to **DNS Host (A)**\n* Enter the public ip address of your server under the *IPv4 Address*\n* Click *Create Hostname*\n\nSo we are still missing the *Dynamic* part of **Dynamic DNS**. To make it auto update with the new IP, we need to install the No-IP client. Go back to the terminal that is connected to your ubnutu server and enter the commands:\n\n    cd /usr/local/src/\n    sudo wget http://www.no-ip.com/client/linux/noip-duc-linux.tar.gz\n    sudo tar xf noip-duc-linux.tar.gz\n    cd noip-2.1.9-1/\n    sudo make install\n\n>**What does this do**\n>\n>**cd** change directory\n>\n>**wget** web get the no-ip client\n>\n>**tar** means invoke the tar program which is used to compress and decompress tar files (similar to zip files).\n>\n> **x** flags **tar** to extract the contents\n>\n>**f** flag signals to tar that what is following is the filename of the tar file.\n> \n>**cd noip-2.1.9-1/** means change directory to the directory that was decompressed by **tar* \n>\n>**make install** run **make** and build No-IP with the instructions in the  **install** file.\n\n\nDamn! It failed! Why? **make** is not installed. We will need to install this through **apt** to get this working. We are also missing a dependancy **gcc**. Let's get these installed. Enter the command:\n\n    sudo apt install make gcc -y\n\nNow rerun our **make** command...do it the lazy way.\n\n    sudo !-2\n\nYou will be prompted to choose the interface that talks to the internet with. In our case it is **eth0** so enter **0** and hit **ENTER**\n\nYou will then be asked to enter your username/email address and password used for your No-IP account. \n\nAfter entering your credentials, you will likely be defaulted to using the dynamic hostname you just created in No-IP. If you have more than one hostname created, you will be prompted to choose.\n\nYou will be prompted for an update interval. The default is 30 minutes. I recommend setting it to 5 minutes.\n\nNext you will be prompted to run something at startup. Just hit **ENTER**\n\nIf all was successful you should see:\n\n    New configuration file '/tmp/no-ip2.conf' created.\n    \n    mv /tmp/no-ip2.conf /usr/local/etc/no-ip2.conf\n\nCongratulations! We now have Dynamic DNS setup and working.\n\n**Configuring the DNS Client - Linux**\n\nI am only going to go through the configuraton for Linux since this is /r/linux4noobs . [Windows](https://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/docs/admin-guides-sp-859543150/howto-connect-client-configuration/395-how-to-install-the-openvpn-client-on-windows.html), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blinkt.openvpn&hl=en_GB), [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/openvpn-connect/id590379981?mt=8) and [Mac](https://tunnelblick.net/) are quite a bit more straight forward than the Linux.\n\nFirst up, we should edit our client ovpn file because at the moment, it is not using our **No-IP Dynamic DNS**\n\nSo, open the file in vim:\n\n    vim ~/.openvpn/[YOURCLIENTNAME].ovpn\n\nFind the line  **remote [IPADDRESS] [PORT NUMBER]**\n\ne.g. **remote 13.59.65.209 1194**\n\nPut your cursor over the line and remove it then add a new blank line with:\n\n    dd\n    O\n\nNow enter **INSERT** mode with:\n\n    i\n\nType in the following:\n\n    remote [YOUR DYNAMIC DNS HOSTNAME] [PORT NUMBER]\n\nAs an example, mine was:\n\n    remote openvpntutorial.ddns.net 1194\n\nSave the file with the following commands:\n\n**ESC**\n    :wq!\n**ENTER**\n\nCheck it saved right:\n\n    cat ~/.openvpn/[YOURCLIENTNAME].ovpn\n\n\nNow we call **apt** to install the OpenVPN client:\n\n    sudo apt install openvpn\n\nIt should have the changes we made to the remote server with our **Dynamic DNS** name and the **OpenVPN** port number\n\nNext we need to open our VPN connection with the client ovpn file that we used **scp** to copy down to our computer earlier. Make sure to always **sudo** this command, otherwise it won't connect. Enter the command:\n\n    sudo openvpn --config ~/.openvpn/[YOURCLIENTNAME].ovpn\n\nIn my case it was:\n\n    sudo openvpn --config ~/.openvpn/client.ovpn\n\nIf all went well, after a bunch of output lines of text the last one you should get is:\n\n    Initialization Sequence Completed\n\nAnd thats it. We are on our VPN.\n\nTo confirm check your external IP on your server and on your local machine. If they match, you are golden!!\n\n**Optional for the Lazy**\n\nThe last thing I would add to this, to make life a little easier again is to set an alias in your **.bashrc** file to more easily connect to the vpn. You can find the steps above and don't forget to reload your bash config once you set the alias!.\n\nAlso you can make your ssh connection a lot easier. Open up the ssh config file in vim:\n\n    vim  ~/.ssh/config\n\nEnter the following settings at the bottom of the file.\n\n    Host openvpn\n          Hostname [YOUR DYNAMIC DNS HOSTNAME]\n          User ubuntu\n          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/keyfile.pem\n\nSave the file and now you can connect with:\n\n    ssh openvpn\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n\nOne thing I have come across is sometimes (and aparently only on Ubuntu) the VPN config fails to work and you need to add the following lines at the bottom of the ovpn file:\n\n    up /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf\n    down /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf\n\n\n**Quick Edit:**\n\nI'm back from the cabin in the woods and will be answering questions/discussion points as well as fixing up the tutorial shortly! But wanted to point out what /u/NickUnrelatedToPost mentioned in a comment. Thank you for that Nick!\n\n\n> Now, noobs, take note!\n> \n> **What this VPN does for you:**\n> \n> It lets you get around geoblocking.\n> \n> It prevents your employer or ISP from spying on you.\n> \n> It may get you around internet filters in your country (eg. twitter bans).\n> \n> **What VPN does not do:**\n> \n> Protect your identity from the sites you go to.

{"id": "1be4b2v", "instruction": "I really want to love Linux, but doing basic tasks always turns out being a convoluted process.", "input": "So, a bit of backstory. I've been using Linux on and off for about 2 years now, so I'm not exactly a noob, but I'm not experienced either. I started with Ubuntu, and now I'm using Arch. The install was easy for the most part, but the real issues came afterwards.\n\nSo I boot up the system and then notice that the internet is a bit slower than usual. So then I go online and look for the exact driver I needed which took a bit. Then I opened Steam to install games and noticed that it and only it was slower than everything else. So I looked for a few hours until I found an obscure reddit post with like 3 upvotes from 3 years ago that fixed my problem. Okay, so then I go to play my games, and they don't work. So I look online for how to get them to work and hear about all of these obscure launch options. So I go to install these, put in the launch options, and sometimes they work. Sometimes. Other times they don't. Sometimes they have anti cheat that doesn't work on Linux. To play them I'd have to set up either a VM or a dualboot, both of which are a lot of trouble to set up. Maybe I'll just be fine without them. Then there was an issue with bluetooth, so I had to install something and go through a convoluted process to get it all set up.\n\nYou see what I mean here? I really want to love Linux, but every little thing I do comes with a convoluted process that adds on and on until it really isn't worth it anymore. I sometimes spend significantly more time setting things up than actually doing them. I don't like Windows, but at least with that you can just install it and it works. I've heard people say that Linux is more stable than Windows, but I've never had a single crash on Windows, and have had many on Linux. Every time it crashes I have to look through journalctl and find an error that might have caused my problem, and search it up only to find nothing on it. I really like Linux, but I don't want an OS to become my hobby. Sometimes I just need it to just work without tinkering. I wish that I liked using it as much as Windows because I don't like proprietary software. I'm all for free and open source solutions, but I don't think it's ready for my use case yet. I say all of this with no ill feelings towards Linux or its community, but I just don't know if I can do it anymore.\n\nEDIT: Thanks to everyone for the advice! I tried a few distros, and after testing most of them I ended up going with Debian. After a while of using it, I can say that I love it. It took some getting used to for sure, but I think it is a good middle ground between Arch and Ubuntu. Not too easy, not too hard. I'm really glad that everyone here (whether you gave me recommendations on what to do or just called me dumb, which is honestly deserved) for giving me the advice that I needed, and for helping me. I was honestly super close to switching back to Windows out of frustration, but I'm so glad I didn't.", "output": "If you want my advice, don't use Arch. Use Ubuntu."}

I'm only going to list the essentials to keep it simple and to the point. The rest you can pick up a long the way and you can ask if you need help with anything else post setup.\n\n* First thing to do is to update the system and packages. To update the system using the terminal do `sudo apt update`. `apt` is the package manager of Ubuntu/Pop OS deritives. Other distributions use different package managers such as `pacman`, `zypper`,  and `dnf`. The process is almost the same, except `apt` would be substituted with the corresponding package manager on other distros. You may wish to update the system using the software update centre/manager if you prefer.\n\n* I would install `gnome-tweaks` which will allow you to minimize/maximize the windows in Pop OS. By default its usually disabled and requires this extension. \n\n* Install the proprietary NVIDIA driver if you use an NVIDIA card. I believe Pop OS has it pre-installed, however it is useful for other distros where you may need to install it manually. If using AMD, these aren't needed as the drivers are in the kernel.\n\n* For Steam gaming, enable Proton via Settings>Steam Play>Enable Steam Play. This is the compatibility layer which will allow you to play many Windows games under Linux. Check [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/) to check how well a game runs. Not all games work, but the number is increasing.\n\n\nOther than that, I'd say just get farmiliar with using the system, install the apps you need (you may have to download open source alternatives for some) and enjoy the journey. Feel free to ask any questions and good luck :)."}

I was running Windows 10 and it was taking ages to boot up, not just to the log in screen but to actually load up a program once it \"started up\". Multi-tasking had become a joke and for some strange reason loading the first website after starting either Chrome or Firefox always took longer than subsequent loads. It just felt so \"heavy\" and everything seemed like it was just barely chugging along.\n\nThis computer is around 5 to 6 years old, its technology is probably older -- i5 4th gen, 4 GB of RAM, NVIDIA GT 740M. I figured it was breaking down and decided to start looking for a new one. In the process, I figured since I'd be replacing this one soon, I'd just install Lubuntu (being a lightweight distro and all) to see if things would be any different. I had zero expectations anything would change. I figured everything was a hardware problem.\n\nAnd holy cow was I completely wrong. This thing works like its brand new! I can finally do multiple things at once. I can finally run some of those heavy applications that took ages to load on Windows 10; they now load in seconds on Lubuntu! I thought I'd have driver issues but nope, everything worked right out of the box! And I'm not sure if I can't recall correctly or whether this is actually happening but it feels like my Internet's a lot faster on Linux too. I'm pretty sure my download speeds are much higher than normal.\n\nI have seriously reconsidered getting a new computer because it certainly feels like I already have one. I cannot believe Windows 10 was weighing it down so much. For a long time, I've hesitated making a complete switch to Linux but I think this is it. I might miss Microsoft Office, but I'll learn how to make the most of Libre Office and the Google Suite.\n\nI know all of this sounds absurd and it probably sounds like I've discovered a new religion or something but I'm so glad I won't have to spend hundreds of dollars on a new machine and I can just enjoy this one for some time more.", "output": "You’ll probably see the exact same thing if you reinstall windows.

If you're not familiar with it, then I want to make sure you know about it. Basically, if you put Ventoy on a USB drive, you can then add multiple ISOs.

From personal use perspective its definetly a full 100% and I think its a better alternative than windows in a lot of areas like customization etc.\n\nTo make me feel at home with the UI, (Gnome is awesome btw) I used dash to panel, Arc Menu, Minimalistic calendar from gnome extension store. This will make Pop OS (or any gnome desktop) look exactly like Windows 10.\n\nI developed 2 github repos while using Linux for Linux with dotnetcore and visual studio code, very good experience, just like in windows 10, check them out below\n\n[https://github.com/sudipmandal/deepin-ext-cal-sync](https://github.com/sudipmandal/deepin-ext-cal-sync)\n\n[https://github.com/sudipmandal/any-os-wallpaper-cli](https://github.com/sudipmandal/any-os-wallpaper-cli)\n\nHowever there are still things which made me run to my windows machine, Visual Studio for windows workflows development WWF (Dynamics custom workflow) (Mono did not work), Lots of custom non dotnet core tools etc (Wine did not work for them)\n\nHere is a list I compiled for Microsoft Developers who want to give Linux a try but want a picture of what they might be getting into (List compiled with softwares running on POP OS 20.04)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b5365i5i9g251.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=8851a5819834c7b90a0663dbdf953fac53d12f1f\n\n**Final Thoughts :** For Microsoft developers windows is the best option especially with WSL, however for personal machines where you might not want to spend on a windows license, Linux is definetely a good option even for Microsoft development if you are willing to spend time configuring everything. It is certainly more capable now than it was a few years ago.\n\n**UPDATE :**\n\n1. I would like to make clear I am not trying to advertise Windows over Linux, I just want to raise awareness to Microsoft & Windows developers about how Linux is a good alternative to Windows... Yes for us MS devs windows is the best OS for work but that does not mean its perfect ... (dont get me started on windows update etc... it sucks).... This post is intended at enthusiastic windows developers to try out Linux and help them adopt Linux for work. I am sure if the correct developers take note of my points, we can make the above list fully green.\n2. Yes I know how to use a VM and have run Windows OS run as guest on linux, I have mentioned it on the chart above in the last row, and it works great as any other OS on a VM, no complains, however VM is kind of not the point of this post, in order for us Microsoft citizen developers to get the best experience we need native app support from MS just like they did with Teams, hopefully my post draws some attention and MS or some other developer fill in these  gaps for us.\n3. Yes Onedrive works on Linux, however Microsoft has been unfair with it as the Linux client requires approval from a Office 365 admin, this is not required on Windows client. I think it is because the onedrive client apps are actually 3rd party apps and are not release by Microsoft, Really hope this is fixed soon by MS.\n4. Lastly I think FOSS and Linux are the future, Microsoft is doing the right thing by now focusing on cross platform and open source (VS Code, DotNetCore, Typescript just to name a few). We Microsoft citizen developers should follow lead and make Linux an equally great platform for us.", "output": "Reads kinda corporate doesn't it? If W10 is required for work, familiar, and the UI absolutely has to look the same...stick with W10?\n\nIDK. I appreciate that Linux _isn't_ just a W10 clone or lookalike...isn't that one of the main points?"}

So, how do I fix this?\n\n\nTo cut a long story short (and leaving out a lot of useless stumbling around with only the vaguest idea of what I was doing) it occurred to me that something similar had happened to me before when I'd replaced my HDD with a bigger one, and the system failed to boot properly because it was trying to mount a drive that wasn't there.\n\n\nCould changing the partition have had the same effect?\n\n\nI remembered that I'd had to edit fstab to get the new drive mounted in place of the last one. So *where* was fstab?\n\n\nAfter a bit of looking around I eventually found it.\n\n\nI decided I didn't want to mess things up *too* badly in case this didn't work, so:\n\n\n    mv fstab.old fstab.older\n    cp fstab fstab.old\n\n\nBut how to edit it? I don't know how to use vi or emacs. Wait! I vaguely remembered that one of the pages I'd looked up when I first edited fstab had suggested using nano. Worth a try:\n\n\n    nano fstab\n\n\nIt worked!\n\n\nAfter a brief experience of \"Oh crap, I deleted the wrong line. How do I exit without saving?\" I managed to comment-out the line for mounting that partition then save-and-exit.\n\n\nNext step:\n\n\n    reboot\n\n\nWhen I'd tried that before trying to edit fstab I just ended up with it doing a file system check before exiting into emergency mode again.\n\n\nThis time however, it worked!\n\n\nProblem solved all on my own without looking up the answers or falling back on booting from a different distro to use the tools in that distro to fix it.\n\n\nI feel so proud of myself. Like a five year-old feeling proud of themselves for managing to color-in the picture without going outside the lines.\n\n\nIt might not be impressive to anyone else, but it's a personal milestone that I've managed to pass.", "output": "Nice!\n\nYou'd be surprised by how much info you can get by just reading the error messages.

{"id": "18kde7q", "instruction": "Putting Linux on your Mac? Watch out!", "input": "Many people want Linux on their Mac- they are tired of Apple, or maybe they got a Mac just to use for Linux.\n\nI think that's a great idea!\n\nHowever, if you wipe out the original MacOS hard drive partition when installing Linux ... there may be chips on your Mac that use firmware on that MacOS partition. Oops. Also, firmware gets updated all the time. Maybe a new WiFi spec comes out, with a new kind of password security, all the hotspots will be using it soon. Your Mac may support it- with a firmware update. Boot MacOS, do an update, and MacOS will get the new firmware. No MacOS partition? Oooops.\n\nA lot of people select \"Use Entire Hard Drive\" when they install Linux on their Mac. I see posts all over the internet - \"I installed Linux, and now I need such-and-such firmware, how do I get it? What website has it?\" Much of the firmware is copyright and can not be posted on a website. It was on the MacOS partition. Now ... Oh well.\n\nWatch out! Best if you don't delete your existing MacOS partition when installing Linux.\n\nKeeping the MacOS partition is not easy using most Linux installers. This is because Linux installers typically use free disk space outside of any partition when installing. MacOS disk utilities do not easily create free space, they just make and adjust partitions.\n\nHere's what I do. I start MacOS. Run Disk Utility. Right click on the hard drive at the top of the left pane, and select Partition... Click '+' for a new partition, and then \"Add Partition\". Select ExFAT for the Format, which will be changed later. Select however much of the hard drive you want for Linux, but leave enough so that MacOS still fits. If you do not leave enough Disk Utility will let you know. Click Apply. Let it grind for a minute making the space for Linux. Then, reboot to your chosen Linux installer. When the installer is asking how to use the disk, select \"Manual\" or whatever your installer provides, do not select Use Entire Disk or Use Largest Free Space. In the disk partition table it then shows, select the space in the new partition, and then delete the partition. You can typically tell which partition is the new one by the size you made it. Be careful to select the correct partition! Then set up your Linux on this new free space, for example by selecting Guided and then Use Largest Free Space. If there is no Guided or similar selection on the Manual partition table menu, you may have to go back in the menu one or more times to get to a menu asking how to use the disk, depending on your installer.\n\nOnce Linux is being set up in the free space, you can forget about your MacOS. Even with a MacOS partition, a Mac will typically boot to Linux after a Linux install. To get back to MacOS when you need it, try installing something like \"refind\" for multi-boot. This tool is installable under Linux and MacOS, and I have been using it for years. MacOS multi-boot under \"grub\", the normal Linux boot system, does not work reliably for me. You do not need to worry about multi-boot at first if you are only interested in Linux- your Mac will boot Linux after the install. You only need to worry about multi-boot when you want to get back to MacOS, e.g. for your firmware. You can boot to MacOS without multi-boot by holding down Alt during a Mac restart, useful if you do not intend to run MacOS very often. It can be tricky to press Alt at the right time for this.\n\nTypically what happens is something does not work. You google it. You find that the problem is caused by missing firmware. You google it some more. You find instructions that tell you how to copy the missing firmware from MacOS to Linux. You (silently) thank me. You google for this post on reddit, and re-read the previous paragraph. Then you thank me out loud. Then you do the instructions, whatever it was starts working, and you completely forget about me. It's ok, I am used to it. Remember, there are people who have spent many thousands of hours of their lives working on Linux itself. Do we ever remember to thank them?\n\nWish this were simpler and more direct. I actually do it slightly differently: I do not delete the ExFAT partition, but use Configure LVM and convert the ExFAT to an LVM physical partition, but that seems even more complicated. Anybody have any simpler ways to keep a little MacOS, let me know! Also, please add a comment if your installer has different steps for Guided installation into the new partition made by Disk Utility than mine.", "output": "Or, you realize like me that your MacBook Pro is 12 years old, you’ve gotten your money’s worth out of it, and you just completely replace hard drive and RAM and install Linux until the laptop no longer functions."}

As someone who's deep diving linux for the last 2-3 months properly as part of my daily driver, why do people seem to hate it?", "output": "Systemd is an Init (Initialization), this type of program is the one that manages all system and user processes to start, stop and even plays a crucial role in controlling the resource usage on your PC.\n\nInits are started right after the kernel is started when you turn on your PC. They are extremely important for the system.\n\nMany users complain that Systemd does not follow the Unix philosophy of \"Do one thing, and do it well\". Instead of being a set of small, modular tools that interact with each other, Systemd is a monolithic system that encompasses multiple functions beyond system initialization (*init*), such as service management, logging (*journald*), device management (*udevd*), networking (*networkd*), and more. This makes it more complex, interdependent and difficult to debug or replace with individual components, which goes against the minimalist and modular approach of Unix.\n\nOther Init like OpenRC, s6 or Runit are more modular and smaller, maybe even **faster** than Systemd but they are not as established as Systemd or not as compatible at the moment.\n\nPersonally I don't care, Systemd works and I don't have the slightest intention to change it as I don't see the point in doing so. Why would you change something manually that works and on top of that most popular distributions are built with Systemd in mind?"}

They can be moved over to your main drive easily though through steam, making migrating from windows fairly easy.\n* ~~Discord screen sharing is a problem, I had to use a custom client (vencord) and install pipewire (Mint uses pulseaudio) otherwise your stream won't pick up sound~~.

I have found that OnlyOffice has far greater compatility for doc/docx files than LibreOffice. OnlyOffice has also been fantastic for Excel files, in particular Excel spreadsheets that LibreOffice choked on. When it comes to Powerpoint, LibreOffice still is superior in terms of compatability, but there are always small things that dont match up. \n\nOne trick is to make sure you install the microsoft ttf fonts - this really improves compatability and makes your life easier. The packages are distribution dependent - I was able to find all the needed fonts via the Arch Linux Repositories (I use Manjaro).  \n\nIf you can use Office365 online, things become much, much easier. There is an unofficial Microsoft OneDrive sync utility (https://github.com/skilion/onedrive) that seems to work quite well, which would help you live in a Microsoft world more easily.\n\nFinally, Adobe support is another area of friction. There is really no Adobe software for linux that is viable any more. The free version of MasterPDFEditor and FoxitReader fill this gap pretty well.

It has 3 monitors,  Each monitor can independently switch between six \"tags\" (kind of like virtual desktops).  Windows on each monitor/tag are automatically tiled, so they never overlap.  I can control everything from the keyboard.  I have custom rules written to place certain commonly-used programs on specific monitors/tags.  So, for example, I can launch a virtual machine, it will start up in a pre-assigned tag on a certain monitor without covering up what I'm working on.  When it's booted and i'm ready to use it, I can switch over to where it is.\n\nI can go on, but you get the picture.  My environment is highly tailored to reduce friction in my workflow.\n\n**Install it on just about anything for free**\n\nI have a large family and not much income.  People give me old computers sometimes, often 6-10 year old devices.  I know that no matter what I receive, I can install a fresh, supported, fully-functional OS on that device.  I don't have to break any laws, run an outdated OS, or buy some expensive software that may or may not work.\n\nIf the hardware is old or low-powered, I can customize the OS to work with it.  The average age of running, daily-use computers in my house is about 5 years, but they all run an OS that is getting security updates and modern software.\n\n**Interact directly with the people who write the software I use**\n\nI record music using a program called qtractor.

{"id": "1jjo962", "instruction": "Do not buy any Linux antivirus", "input": "I prepared a long answer to a post that was deleted, here it is as this is a recurring question: what antivirus should I installed on my Linux PC? Should I pay $50 for this or that?\n\nTL;DR: **Avoid these pieces of software like the plague! Do not buy any antivirus for your Linux machine**. It is not useless, it is toxic!\n\nA bit of history:  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline\\_of\\_computer\\_viruses\\_and\\_worms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_computer_viruses_and_worms)  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware#History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware#History)  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer\\_worm#History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm#History)  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus\\_software#History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software#History)\n\nSo:\n\n1. John von Neumann wrote a paper about self replicating computer programs in 1949. [Fred Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Cohen) published \"Computer Viruses – Theory and Experiments\" in 1984. He published his PhD thesis on the topic in January 1986. All these were formal computer science papers, but there are some conclusions that can be applied to real life anyway: no algorithm that can perfectly detect all possible viruses.\n2. Morris worm, one of the first Internet worms (and the most famous?) was released in November 1988. \"Worm\" in that sense was first used in a 1975 novel. [The first computer worms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creeper_and_Reaper) appeared on ARPANET in the 70s.\n3. The first PC virus (MS/DOS) was Brain in 1986. After that there were California, Jerusalem in 87 or 88 IIRC. I saw an antivirus software (from Eliashim Microcomputers) for the first time in 1988.\n\nSo... Viruses, worms and other malware have been theorized for more than 40 years, or even 76; they have been designed experimentally for 50 years, and really malicious programs and AV software appeared \\~ 40 years ago.  You could think that anti-malware is a mature technology and that the malware problem has been eradicated. This is not the case.  \n**Blacklist (signature based) scanners do not work and will never work** \\-- read Fred Cohen's papers if you did not understand that. Behavior detection is a bit better but far from perfect; in practice, it does not work either.\n\nActually, **computer security is one of the few technical domains where it is possible to sell and resell utterly inefficient technologies**. e.g. in 2000 IDS did not work and most companies that sold them collapsed when the dotcom bubble burst; IDS were repackaged and sold as IPS ten years later.\n\nAs far as security is concerned, current antivirus implementations are just horrible: one big opaque bloatware that runs with System privileges and regularly downloads opaque updates without telling you what it is doing. The attack surface is enormous.\n\nBy the way, many Linux AV install proprietary kernel modules. This is probably useless as the kernel already provides kazillons of security mechanisms or [modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Security_Modules), and this is toxic as it will be compatible with just the right kernel version... Said in another way, you might be blocked with a vulnerable kernel version if the company does not recompile their module when an updated kernel version is available.\n\nBe kind to your system and your wallet: do not buy these software, learn how Linux security works, install and configure a good RBAC system if you want more than the basic Linux access control (AppArmor or SELinux are the most known, they come with default policies), run backups to be able to restore your system when it is infected, keep your computer up to date, do not install any suspicious software on your machine, if you need to do that, use a virtual machine or a container, etc. etc.\n\nTo give you an example how rotten this market is even for big companies... [MS ATP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint) is supposed to be a more serious enterprise solution.

It barely scraped the surface of my mind as anything other than another niche. It didn't help that I deemed myself an expert in what I felt was the best secured, advanced, and most robust system on the planet earth, Windows XP. Oh but a fool I was, bathing in ignorance.\n\n​\n\n**What is it that causes such bias to a misunderstood masterpiece?**\n\n​\n\nWas it the fear of becoming a beginner in a subject I felt so at home with? Or was it a refusal to move forwards into an endless era of learning rather than bask in blissful expertise. Maybe it was because my mind was so blanketed in caffeine and binge gaming. Little did I know in my ignorance, I would find solace in an unending battle through life.\n\n​\n\n**How does the switch over to Linux take so long?**\n\n​\n\nI pop the SD card in. Too impatient by my sporadic idea to reformat to go get a USB or DVD or even to properly research into what I was doing. *\\\\*bleep\\*\\* My laptop boots up and I press F12, anxiously I wait what seems like fourteen generations for the three second long black screen to finish as the laptop loads the boot manager. There was only one option and it was the Windows Boot Manager. *doh* In my rush I forgot to put the SD card in an adapter (it wouldn't boot directly in the SD slot). I boot up again, the anxiety turned somewhat into impatience, and I wait ready. *bash* I hit the F12 key with the force of a thousand boots. This time the boot menu had two options, one of them the SD card.\n\n​\n\n**Why you should never start with Arch Linux.**\n\n​\n\nThere is a pretty big problem with Arch Linux. It's absolutely perfect, being an operating system with both great support and nearly unparalleled customizability. For a beginner, the enticement is too much to bare. To fall into the trap of Arch is to spend hours learning from the ground up, only to find in the end you don't have any idea what you just did or how to fix the error you got on step one-hundred and twenty-two. Finally after three attempts, I managed to get all the way to installing GRUB. Despite numerous numbing attempts I couldn't get past an EFI error. In a slump I gave up, having a laptop containing a formatted hard-drive, with random data written over 3 passes...\n\n​\n\n**When you switch to Linux, do yourself a favour and take the time to research.**\n\n​\n\n... I snapped to alertness, in my daze of brewing my third pot of coffee. I have an SD card with Ubuntu on it! I realised in the middle of adding a spoon of coffee grounds to the filter. Almost forgetting entirely of the coffee, I rushed off to my laptop and popped the Ubuntu SD card in. I had a feeling after learning about Arch Linux that I would need a backup distro just in case. The boot process took barely twenty minutes. I hardly knew where to start with my brand new OS, so naturally, my first thought was to open up youtube.\n\n​\n\n**Where do you take yourself from here?**\n\n​\n\nIf I had to describe the Linux experience in one word, it would be 'vast'. You can take any technological idea available to the human mind, and undertake it with Linux. The possibilities are only limited by your creativity, and availability of hardware. For myself personally, I will be using it for a business system as well as a research computer. Security has become important to me due to sensitive customer data, and the learning curve to securing a daily use system has been both daunting and rewarding. I sit here now, watching 'The Office' on Netflix, typing out some creativity as I dwell on some Wireshark idea's.\n\n​\n\nI hope everybody who has swapped over to Linux has a tale to tell, no matter how long or small.

Just use Mint. Try it, commit to using it, learn and enjoy the ride.\n\nIf you have never used Linux before... \nYou will never overcome the paralysis due to having many options until you really try something and use it for some time. It is then that you will realize what you need, what you like and what you don't.\n\nThere is no point in pondering a lot on which distro is perfect for you, if you have never used any distro before. Just go for it!\n\nYes, there are some very specific hardware-related points to make. But for the most part. Just use Mint.\n\nEdit2: I did not think I would get so many comments. But after reading many people's opinions. I agree with many of you. Using Linux is a Journey that feels scary, but the first step is to choose something and get started, experiment and after some time see what works for you. I don't even use Mint, but it helped me to ditch Windows, stop thinking on switching, and just commit to Linux.\nYes, there are more things to talk about, X11, Wayland, newer drivers for GPUs, preference, philosofy etc. But IMO the best first step is to actually get started, no matter where you start.\nAnd apparently, for Nvidia Gamers out there, it seems that Bazzite is the new Linux Mint, so if you are a Gamer, it is worth to check it out.

Clean, modern?\n* How much RAM does it need?\n* Is it possible to download the e-mails locally or to create an offline cache?\n* does the mail client instantly choose the receivers e-mail address as sender-address for replies if I have more than one alias?\n* does the mail client closes the application if you click on \"x\" and doesn't keep it still running in the background?\n\nAfter some testing, this are my results:\n\n# Geary\n\n[Picture Source: https:\\/\\/wiki.gnome.org\\/Apps\\/Geary](https://preview.redd.it/j0u5vjpv9rw71.png?width=1652&format=png&auto=webp&s=9923a43c4c5b4bc4bb906ec490a966f822030089)\n\n* ✅ Simple, clean overview\n* ✅ (only) \\~30 MB RAM\n* ✅ offline cache is possible\n* ❌ the client doesn't close completely if you click the \"x\" button\n* ❌ the client also doesn't choose the correct alias as sender-address for mails sent to an alias\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Evolution\n\n[picture taken by myself; appearance might vary, because I'm using ubuntu budgie with the \\\\\"whitesur\\\\\" theme\\/icons](https://preview.redd.it/jbmps3xkbrw71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=865781f0479c295d93d720acc830b909b083742e)\n\n* ✅ clean overview, not too simple, but also not overloaded\n* ✅ \\~78 MB RAM\n* ✅ Offline cache is a little bit hided, but is kinda working; choosing all e-mails and exporting them in as a .mbox file is possible\n* ✅ the client closes with clicking the \"x\" button\n* ✅ application is choosing the correct alias for replies\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n\n* ❌ offline cache function could be more clear and easier\n* ❌ backing up the configuration **+mails** could be a function\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Mailspring\n\n[Picture Source: https:\\/\\/getmailspring.com\\/](https://preview.redd.it/n7xqt13tbrw71.png?width=1572&format=png&auto=webp&s=e30168dd67b2ba69531fdb5e4755c1f7d43f6cb8)\n\n* ✅ Looks extremely modern/nice\n* ✅ \\~72 MB RAM\n* ❌ offline cache maybe exist?

How do I install it?\n\n\nThanks for reading, And I hope I can get it up and running and join this amazing community!", "output": "Your laptop will almost definitely run Ubuntu - one of my PCs is over 10 years old and still doing OK.\n\nYou might also consider a distro like Linux Mint which is very slick and designed to make it easier for people coming from Windows. It's Ubuntu + some other stuff, so you can still run programs designed for Ubuntu. Or you can just run Ubuntu if that's your thing.\n\nI'm not sure about \"risks.\" If you plan to dual-boot with Windows (so you get a prompt when you switch on your PC and can boot either Windows or Linux) the risk is you accidentally wipe your Windows during the Linux install process. But just be careful which buttons you click when asked what you want to do. If you plan to wipe your Windows completely, just ensure you have your data backed up to USB or somewhere else.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"side-load\". The options are:\n\n- Install Linux and wipe your Windows off the laptop.\n- Install Linux alongside Windows, at which point you can boot either to Windows or Linux.\n- Use a virtual machine under Linux and run Windows in that.\n\nFor the virtual machine (VM) option, you could look at VirtualBox which is a free download. You can run Linux in that and get a feel of whether it's right for you or not. You can practice installing Linux in the VM with the certain knowledge the only thing you will break if you get it wrong, is the VM, not the PC you are running it on. Switch to full-screen mode in the VM and it will be pretty much the same as running Linux native.\n\nAs for how to install, download the ISO (DVD image) of the distro you want. If you plan to install it on your laptop use a tool like Rufus, BalenaEtcher or YUMI (google) to copy it to a USB key, boot off that USB key and then follow the prompts.\n\nIf you want to run a VM, go to the VM configuration and select the Linux ISO as the optical device (so it's available as a DVD in the VM). You will either get a step-by-step installer, or be booted to a Linux desktop in \"live mode\" which gives you the chance to try it out for a bit. If you want to install, there will be an \"Install Linux\" link on the desktop.\n\n**Note** that all this is just an outline. Google is your friend, learn to read the docs from the distro (usually \"Getting Started\" or \"Installation\"). I highly recommend trying things out in a VM first then see if you want to make the jump to full-time use. The learning you get from using VMs will be very valuable whatever you choose - they are used *everywhere* nowadays. And so is Linux, by-and-large, so you can't go wrong by learning some more about both technologies."}

That’s not to say Linux itself is challenging, but any switching of an entire operating system WILL be challenging)\n\n- You have slow hardware (Windows is very bloated, slowing it down A LOT. This isn’t as noticeable on modern hardware, but if you have an old laptop that is too slow for windows, and you want to keep on using it, Linux is known for breathing life into otherwise unusable computers.)", "output": "I've used Windows and Linux in parallel, on separate computers, for close to two decades.\n\nThe core principle that was hammered into my head in the 1960's (use case determines requirements, requirements determine selection) is the critical factor for selecting an operating system, as is the case with all technology decisions.\n\nIf Linux isn't a good fit for your use case, then don't use Linux.  Trying to fit a use case into an operating system is the rough equivalent of pounding a square peg into a round hole.\n\nJust follow your use case."}

I saw them this weekend and decided to do a test with an old Windows Vista PC they no longer use because it was painfully slow. Didn't bother with the data that was on it so I didn't go for a dual boot.I chose Linux Mint XFCE as the PC is getting quite old (2009-10 I think). I also considered Linux Lite but Mint seems to be have more support and documentation. \n\nPreparation : a 8GB USB key, balena etcher installed on another computer, download the iso file you need. Then create your bootable device.\n\nThe rest was crazy simple : turn the computer on, start on the USB device instead of Windows then use the installation wizard that's really well though. In 2h max I revived an old computer that was supposed to go to trash. All the pilots you need are detected and installed on first start. Basic softwares are also pre-installed (Firefox, Thunderbird, libreoffice).\n\nMint XFCE is quite barebone but still very usable for noob parents since the UI is quite close to Windows (start menu at bottom left, you can drag&drop icons and files). As I read on some forums Mint XFCE is not crazy lightweight but it's still light enough to work on 10y-o PC, much better than Vista (not really hard you might say). To me Mint XFCE is a nice balance between accessibility (pre-installed softwares, simple installation) and lightweight. \n\nI setup Firefox and mail just like their W10 PC. I left them the computer for them to test, they can't do anything wrong since there is actually nothing on the computer. If this experience works, I will switch their W10 PC too, maybe try Mint Mate or Cinnamon.", "output": "It's always wonderful to hear about old computers getting a new life. Thanks for sharing."}

I've had it for about 2 weeks now. Before switching, I began learning command line with Cygwin and Bash and have been enjoying that. In the beginning things were a mess since I didn't really understand the file structure on Linux or how to download packages (that's something I'm trying to learn) so I just downloaded things using commandline. Saw it show up in a folder and thought that was sufficient.  I've tried transitioning CLI into linux. For the most part, things are fine. I installed Solus OS as my first Distro even though I realize it has limitations. For me, it really is the small things that give me trouble. I am learning that distros have package managers and getting used to those. However, when a package isn't available I'm left with Github, and I really don't understand how to install things using that. I know I can use wget, curl, etc. I know how to unpack tarball and unzip zip. I know now that it installs into whatever directory I'm in unless I specify. Outside of that, I'm lost due to the following:\n\n1. I go to the latest release of a github page and there are 4 files for example. Tarball, zip, master, source etc. I don't know which to get. Just one? All of them?\n2. I don't know where to install them in the file directory\n3. I don't know how to install them. When to use make install, often times it's not available\n4. I don't know which files I can delete and clean up afterwards\n5. I don't know when to use wget and when to use curl\n\nYesterday I tried following this to set up vim for Python IDE:  [https://realpython.com/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/](https://realpython.com/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/) \n\nEverything was fine except for the YouCompleteMe plugin. I couldn't figure out how to make it work because of the c compiler problem and then the Solus package manager kept telling me in the terminal that cmake3 wasn't available and neither was g++. I decided to leave it and figure it out later. This is what I mean, though. I have to stop and research what cmake and g++ is and that derails trying to get this one thing I need since those are dependencies. I know I'm impatient and want to jump in and have fun and that's my fault. It's just that it gets exhausting.\n\nThings like /.bashrc /.profile /.vimrc are confusing but I'm getting more comfortable. I've tried adding certain themes only to have CLI tell me there are errors and they don't exist. Neomutt has been the worst with this.\n\nAnother even more simple thing. Yesterday I wanted to set up Plex and move some movies on my external hard drive to the server so my family can watch them across the country. Well, root owns almost all directories and files on the hard drive. So, I tried googling and typing stuff in but none of it worked. So I decided to come back to it. However, using google and typing things in with a vague understanding causes issues. Using cygwin on windows in the last two months I have already accidentally deleted all files matching a pattern by using a wildcard. This morning I accidentally set my C: drive permissions to octal code 130 (basically only NT-Admin/System can access it now. I can't even open or read it). So, I had to email IT about that to unlock it and am still waiting for a response. I've definitely been learning to be careful with CLI and have started adding certain safeguards like rm -i into config files. I imagine you mess up a lot to learn.\n\nAm I doing something wrong or is this just the common learning curve? Where can I find information like this that guides you through things like drive permissions, installations, etc? Some things I come across on google are hard to follow as a beginner and some have lead to issues with command line as I've mentioned.", "output": "It is in the beginning."}

I had done some research and found out that you can do automated things like sending a message to your phone when your laptop battery is low, notification after ever specific period of time set and many others. And my question is that how can we do things like this?", "input": ".... Do we have to use command line or to make some script?? And what this automation thing is called in Computer Terms?", "output": "These days with so many APIs and things like that available, you can basically do anything that you set your mind to (within reason; you can't turn your laptop into an Iron Man style holographic interface :D).\n\nAs noted in the other comments, everything is about finding out how to do the pieces individually, then putting the puzzle together.\n\nUnder normal circumstances after you become familiar with Linux, my recommendation is to always start by looking for a complete solution that already exists for your goal.  You don't want to reinvent the wheel when you don't have to.  However, for learning, you *should* reinvent the wheel to learn.  So let's try and build the \"pieces\" to accomplish the example in your topic --- how to send a text message to a phone based on battery life.  Since it seems like you may have never done anything like this, I'm going to give you a step-by-step guide on how you could approach this as a complete newbie.  Then for future ideas, you can use these concepts of \"what to look for,\" etc. to help solve more problems on your own.\n\n1. Google: \"linux get laptop battery percentage\"\n\nIf we dig through the first few results, we can see that the \"acpi\" command will give us output like this, which has the battery level:\n\n    Battery 0: Charging, 17%, 01:20:06 until charged\n\nSo immediately I'm thinking, \"regardless of how to send a notification to my phone, I'm going to have to pluck that ##% out of the output.\n\n2) Google \"linux get field of output\"\n\nThis is going to lead you down a massive rabbit hole of tools like \"grep,\" \"cut,\" \"awk,\" and \"sed\".  These types of tools are exceptionally useful, but can be very challenging to understand for newbies.  What I'm about to propose below will probably be laughed away by the pros, but I think it is an \"easy\" introduction into the concept of text manipulation in Linux while also introducing the concept of \"pipes\" to chain input and output.  We're gonna use \"cut\" --- it's simple and easy to understand.\n\nOne thing we can observe about the acpi output is that it is divided into fields that are \"split\" (\"delimited\") by commas.\n\n    Field 1: Battery 0: Charging\n    Field 2: 17%\n    Field 3: 01:20:06 until charged\n\nSo check this out.  With \"cut\" we can \"cut\" the output based on a specific delimited character, and then grab a specific field.  So we want to \"cut\" this by commas, and then grab field 2, which is where the battery percentage is.  But to do this, first of all, I need to \"convey\" or \"forward\" the output of acpi as input to the \"cut\" command.  You can do this with the \"pipe\".  So check this out, let's look by example:\n\n    $ acpi\n    Battery 0: Charging, 17%, 01:20:06 until charged\n    $ acpi | cut -d\",\" -f2\n     17%\n\nNow for all you experts out there going, \"WELL ACHKUALLY...,\" yes, I know, there are better ways.  This is just done as an introductory example to text manipulating and piping using a command that is easy to digest.  No one new to this is gonna walk away feeling good if you start shoving regular expressions or sed or awk at them.\n\nSo anyway, -d with cut specifies the \"delimiter\" that we want to cut on, and -f specifies which field (starting with 1) that we want to grab.  As you can see, we narrowed this down to \" 17%\".\n\nBut let's think about this for a second.  If we're ultimately going to create some kind of logic that says, \"send notification if the percentage goes below 20%,\" we're going to need to turn this into a standalone number that we can compare (without the extraneous space in the beginning and without the percentage).  Well what can we do?  Let's cut this some more!\n\n    $ acpi | cut -d\",\" -f2 | cut -d\"%\" -f1\n     17\n    $ acpi | cut -d\",\" -f2 | cut -d\"%\" -f1 | cut -d\" \" -f2\n    17\n\nNow we have a one-liner that gives us our battery percentage as just a number!  The key concepts here are \"pipes\" and \"cut\" and in general, \"linux text manipulation\".\n\nThis means we can now create a script like:\n\n    battery_level=`acpi | cut -d\",\" -f2 | cut -d\"%\" -f1 | cut -d\" \" -f2`\n    if [ $battery_level -le 20 ]\n    then\n        echo \"Low battery detected.\"\n        # Send phone notification \n    fi\n\nNow of course, if you're not familiar with basic bash scripting like this, you may need to Google a bit for like \"bash if else\" to get the hang of that syntax, but essentially, we're running our command, getting the number, and then saying, \"is this number less than 20?  If so, send phone notification!\"\n\nBut, the phone sending notification hasn't been coded yet, so this does nothing yet.\n\nSo how do you send text messages to a phone?  Well, your options here are going to vary based on your situation.  I don't actually have a method to test myself to give you some rock solid code that is guaranteed to work, but you would Google \"linux send sms phone message\" and go from there.  I can quickly find some examples that use a range of methods such as \"external\" services like [textbelt.com](https://textbelt.com), to more simple solutions like just using email to SMS.\n\nFor the purposes of keeping the example simple, I'll use a comment from a Reddit thread I found from 7 years ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/20c58i/send\\_an\\_sms\\_text\\_message\\_from\\_the\\_command\\_line/](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/20c58i/send_an_sms_text_message_from_the_command_line/)\n\nTop comment there shows how you can use mail, but whether or not this method would actually work for you depends on conditions such as if your system is capable of sending mail to begin with, as well as if your carrier supports email to SMS support like that.  But let's just go with it and modify our original code:\n\n    battery_level=`acpi | cut -d\",\" -f2 | cut -d\"%\" -f1 | cut -d\" \" -f2`\n    if [ $battery_level -le 20 ]\n    then\n        echo \"Low battery detected.\"\n        mail -s \"Laptop battery low\" yourphonenumber@your.sms.gateway.com\n    fi\n\nNext you would drop this into a script like \"battery\\_alert.sh\".  Then your next task would be to say, \"how can I get this to run once every minute\" --> Google \"periodically run script linux\".  Key tip here: don't just go with the first Google result.  In my case it's telling me to use \"watch\" --- but I would look at all the options available to you.  In this case you'd probably want to use crontab, *but* as a learning experiment, why not try various things?\n\nBut, do keep in mind, you should always be trying to think \"one step ahead\" where possible.  If you set this script to send an SMS at below 20%, and it takes your laptop 60 minutes to drop from 20% to 0%, and you set this script to run once per minute, you will get 60 SNS messages until you either disable the script or charge your battery.  60 SNS messages may not be too bad, but if you set this to run like once every 5 seconds or something instead, you're in for a bad time.  This is something you can keep in mind for future enhancements.  There' s no need to get this perfect on day 1.  Make something that works that isn't going to blow up your phone bill, then iterate on what you made to enhance it, make it better.  If you dedicate some time to this, you can flesh out some additional logic to prevent flooding yourself with messages, etc.  The key is to iterate --- start small, and build on it."}

Windows will lock down the hardware, including but not limited to the **disk**, **graphics**, **WiFi**, **Bluetooth**, **keyboard** and **mouse** when you restart, so it can save a couple seconds at boot time. \n\n\n**It doesn't matter if Windows is on the same drive as Linux, if Windows touched your computer and these settings were on, Linux will struggle to access basic hardware.**\n\n\nPerhaps more obviously, os-prober won't work because Linux is locked out of **any drives that were in use by Windows prior to shutting down**. Trying to install Linux will be unsuccessful, and if you try to force it, you can damage your Windows installation. \n\n\n\nNormal Linux troubleshooting won't help. There are literally dozens of these posts every week where people can't figure out why their graphics / wifi / bluetooth / keyboard etc etc work fine in Windows but are broken / wonky in Linux, *even when Windows is on a completely different disk* and they've followed advice from expert Linux users. That's because it's a Windows issue, not a Linux issue. \n\n\n\n**ADDITIONALLY**, Secure Boot may need to be disabled or otherwise addressed in BIOS. Windows is usually registered as the only valid OS, so trying to add a new OS will be seen as a potential hijack. Windows 11 takes this even further by requiring mandatory Trusted Platform Module (TPM) with the installation. This links your hardware (BIOS) with your specific Windows installation. If you need to use Windows 11, then you may need to research how to disable this. Personally, I will just stick to Windows 10 LTSC.\n\n\nComments, corrections and concerns welcome.  If this post helped solve your problem, leave a comment and please pass along this information.", "output": "This post is mostly mistaken.\n\nOn the positive side: Yes, you should typically disable Windows Fast Startup if you have a dual-boot system.\n\nOn the other hand...\n\n> Windows will lock down the hardware\n\nWindows isn't \"locking down\" the hardware, it's leaving the hardware in a post-initialized state, which Linux drivers may not account for.  They expect the hardware to be un-initialized.  Your post's tone is accusatory where it is not warranted.\n\n> ADDITIONALLY, Secure Boot may need to be disabled or otherwise addressed in BIOS\n\nNo, it doesn't.  Secure Boot's state has nothing to do with Windows Fast Startup, and the only real consideration for whether it should be disabled is whether or not you're running a distribution that signs its boot loader and kernel.\n\nPlease stop making blanket statements to the effect that users should disable security systems, unless you are willing to accept responsibility for malware infections on their systems.\n\nA lot of people look at Secure Boot as protecting the pre-boot environment, as if it is a brief event.  It isn't.  In addition to the OS you interact with on a modern x86 system, there are (at least) two and a half other operating systems running at all times, with *more* control over the system than your primary OS:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iffTJ1vPCSo\n\nSecure Boot's purpose isn't to protect the system you interact with from malware, so much as it is to protect your kernel *and the lower-level operating systems* from malware.  Rootkits that embed themselves in firmware are becoming more common, and they are nearly impossible to remove without specialized equipment. Secure Boot is one of the recommended mitigations:\n\nhttps://usa.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2022_kaspersky-uncovers-third-known-firmware-bootkit\n\nTo expand on that a bit:\n\nOnce malware gets on your system, the malware is likely to begin execution in your user context. The POSIX multi-user design prevents malware from modifying the system outside what your user has permission to modify, unless it can leverage another exploit to get root. And that's where Secure Boot comes in, because in a legacy design, root is the highest level of access, and nothing prevents malware from modifying the kernel or the system firmware from there. Secure Boot adds another level of separation, protecting the system firmware and the kernel from modification by malware.\n\nImagine that malware manages to gain access to a system, and further is able to use a local exploit to get root access.  Maybe it joins a botnet at that point.  It's probably going to take extra steps in order to persist (which is to say that it'll save itself to a file or download a file to execute in the future after a system reboot, and it'll modify the boot process to execute that file).  Now, unless it takes additional steps, it's detectable.  You can use \"ps\" to see it in the process list, or \"ls\" to see its files on disk.  \n\nMany types of malware will take additional steps to hide themselves.  The easy way to do that would be to modify \"ps\" and \"ls\" so that they no longer show the malware in their output.  Simple, right?  But what if you use \"find\" to look at files, or \"top\" to look at processes?  What if you apply updates and overwrite the modified tools?  A more complete hiding effort involves loading a kernel module to that the kernel itself no longer tells user-space about the malware's files, processes, or network traffic!  Now when the operator runs \"ls /\" or \"find /\", the malware's kernel module filters the responses to readdir(), and never includes files that contain the malware.\n\nA modular kernel like Linux inherently allows loading software that can operate at a very low level, and can prevent anti-virus software from discovering and removing the malware.\n\nLinux Secure Boot systems with kernel lockdown will not allow modules to load unless they are signed, and that makes it very difficult if not impossible for an attacker to load a kernel module that can hide malware.  Malware can still modify user-space tools directly, to try to hide itself, but it's much *much* easier to overcome that to determine if a system is infected or not.\n\nAn example malware module can be found here: https://github.com/mncoppola/suterusu\n\nAnd a series of posts describing how all of this works (in rather a *lot* of technical detail) is available here: https://xcellerator.github.io/categories/linux/ (starting with [post 1](https://xcellerator.github.io/posts/linux_rootkits_01/) and proceeding for 9 total posts)\n\n> Windows is usually registered as the only valid OS, so trying to add a new OS will be seen as a potential hijack\n\nThis is complete nonsense."}

This gets around the package manager coordination responsibility by not requiring anything from the system.\n\nExamples of sandboxing schemes are AppImages and Flatpaks, each of which bundle all requirements in an isolated environment, thus avoiding the package conflict issue in exchange for larger install sizes and slower launches."}

You'll get the full Linux experience.\n  * Lots of Linux flavors to choose from. For beginners, Ubuntu and Linux Mint are generally recommended. I have Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, I'd recommend Ubuntu 20.04 LTS since it's newer, but it's all up to you.\n  * However, it can be a pain to constantly be switching between operating systems. Maybe you wanna make the full jump to Linux, maybe you don't.\n  * Life pro tip: if you go down this route, disable Window 10's Fast Startup feature as it will get very screwy with a dual-boot. I've also included a helpful guide in Appendix B.\n* **Using a virtual machine (VM) to run Linux**\n  * Involves downloading a VM, downloading a .iso image file of whatever operating system you'd like, and running on your local machine.\n  * Devours RAM and is generally pretty slow, would not recommend.\n* **Using terminal emulators**\n  * These provide commands and functionality similar to a Linux terminal, but are still running on Windows architecture.\n  * These days, the most commonly-used Linux terminal is called bash. bash stands for Bourne Again Shell (no, Bourne is not a typo), and is likely what you'll be using as well.\n  * Terminal emulators generally don't include a package manager, i.e. you can't download new bash programs, so pretty limited for general usage. BUT you can install a package manager externally, kind of hacky but can work.\n  * Examples of terminal emulators include PuTTY, Git Bash, msys2 and mingw.\n* **Using Windows Subsystem for Linux (either WSL 1 or WSL 2)**\n  * WSL provides a compatibility layer for running GNU/Linux programs natively on Windows 10. It has integration features certain Windows 10 development apps (notably Visual Studio Code) as well.\n  * You've got two options, WSL 1 and WSL 2. WSL 2 was recently released and features a real Linux kernel, as opposed to an simulated kernel in WSL. This means WSL 2 offers significant performance advantages, but still lacks some of WSL 1's features.\n  * WSL 1 is what I currently use, and thus what I'll be talking about in this guide. I'm not necessarily recommending it, frankly I regret not doing a dual-boot sooner and ditching Windows, but a dual-boot isn't for everyone and takes a lot of time you might not have right now.\n  * Getting WSL initially setup is easy, but making it run smoothly requires some effort, and some features (like audio playback or displaying GUIs) require workarounds you can research if interested. WSL will also not work properly with low-level system tools.\n\n  With that out of the way, let's get started with setting up WSL 1 on your Windows 10 machine.\n\n\n## Setting up WSL\n\nSo if you've read this far I've convinced you to use WSL. Let's get started with setting it up. The very basics are outlined in Microsoft's guide [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10),  I'll be covering what they talk about and diving into some other stuff.\n\n\n### 1. Installing WSL\n\nPress the Windows key (henceforth Winkey) and type in `PowerShell`. Right-click the icon and select `run as administrator`. Next, paste in this command:\n\n    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart\n\nNow you'll want to perform a hard shutdown on your computer. This can become unecessarily complicated because of Window's fast startup feature, but here we go. First try pressing the Winkey, clicking on the power icon, and selecting `Shut Down` while holding down the shift key. Let go of the shift key and the mouse, and let it shutdown. Great! Now open up `Command Prompt` and type in \n\n    wsl --help\n\nIf you get a large text output, WSL has been successfully enabled on your machine. If nothing happens, your computer failed at performing a hard shutdown, in which case you can try the age-old technique of just holding down your computer's power button until the computer turns itself off. Make sure you don't have any unsaved documents open when you do this. \n\n### 2. Installing Ubuntu\n\nGreat! Now that you've got WSL installed, let's download a Linux distro. Press the Winkey and type in `Microsoft Store`. Now use the store's search icon and type in `Ubuntu`. Ubuntu is a Debian-based Linux distribution, and seems to have the best integration with WSL, so that's what we'll be going for. If you want to be quirky, [here are some other options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-your-linux-distribution-of-choice). Once you type in Ubuntu three options should pop up: Ubuntu, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\n\n![Windows Store](https://theshepord.github.io/intro-to-WSL/docs/images/winstore.png)\nInstalling plain-old \"Ubuntu\" will mean the app updates whenever a new major Ubuntu distribution is released. The current version (as of 09/02/2020) is Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS. The other two are older distributions of Ubuntu. For most use-cases, i.e. unless you're running some software that will break when upgrading, you'll want to pick the regular Ubuntu option. That's what I did.\n\nOnce that's done installing, again hit Winkey and open up Ubuntu. A console window should open up, asking you to wait a minute or two for files to de-compress and be stored on your PC. All future launches should take less than a second. It'll then prompt you to create a username and password. I'd recommend sticking to whatever your Windows username and password is so that you don't have to juggle around two different user/password combinations, but up to you.\n\nFinally, to upgrade all your packages, type in\n\n    sudo apt-get update\n\nAnd then \n\n    sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n`apt-get` is the Ubuntu package manager, this is what you'll be using to install additional programs on WSL.\n\n### 3. Making things nice and crispy: an introduction to UNIX-based filesystems\n\n*tl;dr skip to the next section*\n\nThe two above steps are technically all you need for running WSL on your system. However, you may notice that whenever you open up the Ubuntu app your current folder seems to be completely random. If you type in `pwd` (for Print Working Directory, 'directory' is synonymous with 'folder') inside Ubuntu and hit enter, you'll likely get some output akin to `/home/<your_username>`. Where is this folder? Is it my home folder? Type in `ls` (for LiSt) to see what files are in this folder. Probably you won't get any output, because surprise surprise this folder is not your Windows home folder and is in fact empty (okay it's actually not empty, which we'll see in a bit. If you type in `ls -a`, a for All, you'll see other files but notice they have a period in front of them. This is a convention for specifying files that should be hidden by default, and `ls`, as well as most other commands, will honor this convention. Anyways).\n\nSo where is my Windows home folder? Is WSL completely separate from Windows? Nope! This is Windows Subsystem for Linux after all. Notice how, when you typed `pwd` earlier, the address you got was `/home/<your_username>`. Notice that forward-slash right before `home`. That forward-slash indicates the root directory (not to be confused with the `/root` directory), which is the directory at the top of the directory hierarchy and contains all other directories in your system. So if we type `ls /`, you'll see what are the top-most directories in your system. Okay, great. They have a bunch of seemingly random names. Except, shocker, they aren't random. I've provided a quick run-down in Appendix A.\n\nFor now, though, we'll focus on `/mnt`, which stands for mount. This is where your C drive, which contains all your Windows stuff, is mounted. So if you type `ls /mnt/c`, you'll begin to notice some familiar folders. Type in `ls /mnt/c/Users`, and voilà, there's your Windows home folder. Remember this filepath, `/mnt/c/Users/<your_Windows_home_folder>`. When we open up Ubuntu, we don't want it tossing us in this random `/home/<your_username>` directory, we want our Windows home folder. Let's change that!\n\n\n### 4. Changing your default home folder\n\nType in `sudo vim /etc/passwd`. You'll likely be prompted for your Ubuntu's password. `sudo` is a command that gives you root privileges in bash (akin to Windows's right-click then selecting 'Run as administrator'). `vim` is a command-line text-editing tool, which out-of-the-box functions kind of like a crummy Notepad (you can customize it infinitely though, and some people have insane vim setups. Appendix B has more info). `/etc/passwd` is a plaintext file that historically was used to store passwords back when encryption wasn't a big deal, but now instead stores essential user info used every time you open up WSL.\n\nAnyway, once you've typed that in, your shell should look something like this:\n![vim /etc/passwd](https://theshepord.github.io/intro-to-WSL/docs/images/vim-etc-passwd.png)\n\nUsing arrow-keys, find the entry that begins with your Ubuntu username. It should be towards the bottom of the file. In my case, the line looks like\n\n    theshep:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/pizzatron3000:/bin/bash\n\nSee that cringy, crummy `/home/pizzatron3000`? Not only do I regret that username to this day, it's also not where we want our home directory. Let's change that! Press `i` to initiate vim's -- INSERT -- mode. Use arrow-keys to navigate to that section, and delete `/home/<your_username>` by holding down backspace. Remember that filepath I asked you to remember? `/mnt/c/Users/<your_Windows_home_folder>`. Type that in. For me, the line now looks like\n\n    theshep:x:1000:1000:,,,:/mnt/c/Users/lucas:/bin/bash\n\nNext, press `esc` to exit insert mode, then type in the following:\n\n    :wq\n\nThe `:` tells vim you're inputting a command, `w` means write, and `q` means quit. If you've screwed up any of the above sections, you can also type in `:q!` to exit vim without saving the file. Just remember to exit insert mode by pressing `esc` before inputting commands, else you'll instead be writing to the file.\n\nGreat! If you now open up a new terminal and type in `pwd`, you should be in your Window's home folder! However, things seem to be lacking their usual color...\n\n\n### 5. Importing your configuration files into the new home directory\n\nYour home folder contains all your Ubuntu and bash configuration files. However, since we just changed the home folder to your Window's home folder, we've lost these configuration files. Let's bring them back! These configuration files are hidden inside `/home/<your_Ubuntu_username>`, and they all start with a `.` in front of the filename. So let's copy them over into your new home directory! Type in the following:\n\n    cp -r /home/<your_Ubuntu_username>/. ~\n\n`cp` stands for CoPy, -r stands for recursive (i.e. descend into directories), the `.` at the end is cp-specific syntax that lets it copy anything, including hidden files, and the `~` is a quick way of writing your home directory's filepath (which would be `/mnt/c/Users/<your_Windows_username>`) without having to type all that in again. Once you've run this, all your configuration files should now be present in your new home directory. Configuration files like `.bashrc`, `.profile`, and `.bash_profile` essentially provide commands that are run whenever you open a new shell. So now, if you open a new shell, everything should be working normally. Amazing. We're done!\n\n### 6. Tips & tricks\n\nHere are two handy commands you can add to your `.profile` file. Run `vim ~/.profile`, then, type these in at the top of the `.profile` file, one per line, using the commands we discussed previously (`i` to enter insert mode, `esc` to exit insert mode, `:wq` to save and quit).\n\n`alias rm='rm -i'` makes it so that the `rm` command will always ask for confirmation when you're deleting a file. `rm`, for ReMove, is like a Windows delete except literally permanent and you will lose that data for good, so it's nice to have this extra safeguard. You can type `rm -f` to bypass. Linux can be super powerful, but with great power comes great responsibility. NEVER NEVER NEVER type in `rm -rf /`, this is saying 'delete literally everything and don't ask for confirmation', your computer will die. Newer versions of `rm` fail when you type this in, but don't push your luck. You've been warned. Be careful.\n\n`export DISPLAY=:0` if you [install XLaunch VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/), this line allows you to open graphical interfaces through Ubuntu. The `export` sets the environment variable `DISPLAY`, and the `:0` tells Ubuntu that it should use the localhost display.\n\n\n## Appendix A: brief intro to top-level UNIX directories\n\n*tl;dr only mess with `/mnt`, `/home`, and maybe maybe `/usr`. Don't touch anything else.*\n\n* `bin`: binaries, contains Ubuntu binary (aka executable) files that are used in bash. Here you'll find the binaries that execute commands like `ls` and `pwd`. Similar to /usr/bin, but `bin` gets loaded earlier in the booting process so it contains the most important commands.\n* `boot`: contains information for operating system booting. Empty in WSL, because WSL isn't an operating system.\n* `dev`: devices, provides files that allow Ubuntu to communicate with I/O devices. One useful file here is `/dev/null`, which is basically an information black hole that automatically deletes any data you pass it.\n* `etc`: no idea why it's called etc, but it contains system-wide configuration files\n* `home`: equivalent to Window's C:/Users folder, contains home folders for the different users. In an Ubuntu system, under `/home/<username>` you'd find the Documents folder, Downloads folder, etc.\n* `lib`: libraries used by the system\n* `lib64` 64-bit libraries used by the system\n* `mnt`: mount, where your drives are located\n* `opt`: third-party applications that (usually) don't have any dependencies outside the scope of their own package\n* `proc`: process information, contains runtime information about your system (e.g. memory, mounted devices, hardware configurations, etc)\n* `run`: directory for programs to store runtime information.\n* `srv`: server folder, holds data to be served in protocols like ftp, www, cvs, and others\n* `sys`: system, provides information about different I/O devices to the Linux Kernel. If `dev` files allows you to access I/O devices, `sys` files tells you information about these devices.\n* `tmp`: temporary, these are system runtime files that are (in most Linux distros) cleared out after every reboot. It's also sort of deprecated for security reasons, and programs will generally prefer to use `run`.\n* `usr`: contains additional UNIX commands, header files for compiling C programs, among other things. Kind of like `bin` but for less important programs. Most of everything you install using `apt-get` ends up here.\n* `var`: variable, contains variable data such as logs, databases, e-mail etc, but that persist across different boots.\n\nAlso keep in mind that all of this is just convention. No Linux distribution needs to follow this file structure, and in fact almost all will deviate from what I just described. Hell, you could make your own Linux fork where `/mnt/c` information is stored in `tmp`.\n\n## Appendix B: random resources\n\n* [Ubuntu basics](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)\n* [Using WSL in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl)\n* [Intro to regex for Linux](https://www.linux.com/topic/desktop/introduction-regular-expressions-new-linux-users/)\n* [Installing Docker on WSL](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/setting-up-docker-for-windows-and-wsl-to-work-flawlessly)\n* [Setting up audio on WSL](https://research.wmz.ninja/articles/2017/11/setting-up-wsl-with-graphics-and-audio.html)\n* [Installing WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)\n* [Windows 10 / Ubuntu Dual-boot](https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-1404-dual-boot-mode-windows-8-81-uefi/)\n* [Spicing up vim](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-things-need-put-vim-config-file/)\n\n\nEDIT: implemented various changes suggested in the comments.

Git Bash isn't any kind of emulator.

Installing linux is something that you choose to do and when it happens. There are an infinite number of things that could happen to your computer at any time, without notice, and without your permission that could make it so that you can’t use any of the data that is on it. If you don’t have a copy of your files somewhere else, it will be gone forever.\n\nBacking up your data does not have to be difficult nor complex.

If you can put it back the way it was before you started messing with it you can  hack up pretty much anything you want without fear.\n\nBut yeah - your backup solution doesn't need to be perfect out of the gate, just get some kind of backup thing going and if you can, automate it so you don't have to worry about it.  You can always improve your backup solution as you learn, but getting stuff backed up is kind of a Big Deal.\n\ncheers -"}

{"id": "2yctuy", "instruction": "ELI5: How can Linux update without restarting or stopping your work in any way, but Windows needs to restart anywhere from one time to five in order to install updates?", "input": "", "output": "First, it is not true that linux can update everything without reboot..or restart. Update your graphic drivers and you will need at least a Xorg restart, update the kernel and you will need a reboot (Yes, I know...but the new system introduced in 4.0 is still far from being easily usable...and probably never will be for a desktop system).\n\nNow that said, one of the reasons why far fewer restarts are needed is because the components that make up a linux system are more standalone. Example Xorg again...a linux system is completely capable of running without any graphical interface...Xorg runs on top of linux but is not really part of it. So any update to Xorg at most will need an Xorg restart but not of the whole system.\n\nThis also covers a second point...in windows restarts are often needed for the install procedure. Some actions really don't like it if the component they work on is in use at the same time. Windows has an interesting way to still perform those actions....they do them at system start before anything really gets used. This is needed because the components are much higher integrated with each other so it's not really possible to stop only one thing. Because if the independence of the components on a linux system this is much easier to do..single components can be restarted or taking off for an update without having an influence on the whole system.\n\nAnother reason, which is also a problem is how library updates are handled. You can at any time just delete a library on a linux system (.so files) and the programs already running and using that library won't even notice it. They have that library loaded in memory and the actually file is not needed any more. That means that updates can easily just replace libraries without anything noticing it. But!..that leads to one problem. If a program is using a library and that library gets updated the running program will still use the old library in memory. Programs have to be restarted to make use of the updated library file. For a desktop system usually not a big problem...it gets rebooted every few days anyway and all programs are restarted. But for long running servers this is actually a real problem and something admins have to take care of."}

But in Linux even that can be chosen, so I am just wondering what \"makes\" a different distro really DIFFERENT.\n\n**Edit**: thanks for all the awesome replies, I can definitely say that everything is much more clear now about distros and how they are put together :)", "output": "Essentially the difference is how the distro is packaged. You can make your own essentially.\n\nLinux is a quite small kernel. On top of that you pick and chose lots of different packages and systems. But it's all the same Linux when you boil it down.\n\nUsing a distro is really just a lazy way to let others make the framework for you.\n\nNot that it's wrong mind you.\n\nFor example you might want Debian for servers as they are solid and stable. You want that.  For a desktop you might want Ubuntu as it's user friendly. And for development and testing you light want arc as it's the latest and thus gives you a better chance at finding bugs in current software.\n\nBut it's all still Linux."}

I've been working with Linux since 1998, when everything was really difficult. I've been teaching a few people Linux 1-on-1, and found that I *really* enjoy it. I've decided that I'd like to teach more people.\n\nMy intention in doing this class is to take people from knowing nothing about Linux, to being able to work as a sys admin. We'll work with many distros, services, AWS, etc. I'm going to start with the basics (e.g., `ls`, the filesystem, etc), and move into more advanced topics. For the first part of the class, I'm basically following the outline for the RHCE certification exam.\n\nAfter Linux has been learned, I plan on setting up an environment for web apps, using Docker, Nginx, etc. We will then move into development of a web app.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Does anyone know a platform where I can teach (others watch), and if people have questions they can queue up. Then, when I am ready to take questions, I can go through the queue of people and let them ask. The biggest thing I want is the ability to take questions in an organized fashion.\n\n2. Anyone who has ever tried to learn Linux, or wants to know more about it, what topics would you like to see covered? I'm really interested in feedback here. I'd like to know what aspects people would like to learn.\n\n3. For the web app, any ideas on a fun, and relatively easy, web app that we could create together would be awesome.

I'm creating the syllabus at this point, and the feedback I receive here will help me in shaping the syllabus.\n\nThanks all.\n\nEDIT: Like an idiot, I deleted my very informative post.

{"id": "9q2rv6", "instruction": "Useful command line tools and tips", "input": "Hoping that this might help newcomers, in this post I present the tools I often use with some background why and how it can hopefully help you.\n\nI've started using Linux as my main OS in 2007 or 2008 with some trying it the years before and I remember that at the beginning, the shell is rather scary and mainly used to run commands that were copied from somewhere. I hope that you find some inspiration in this post to shift some of your workflow to the shell. Please understand that I won't give detailed usage examples, you can find those on the web easily, otherwise this post would become way too long.\n\nAlso be aware that some examples might include functionality I mention later. Read the whole thing!\n\nIn no particular order:\n\n### tmux\ntmux is the Terminal MULtiplexer. What does that mean? Basically it allows you to divide a single shell window into multiple, which is the first thing it does. It can either be done using so-called windows (which is comparable to a browser's tab) and panes (which is comparable to a website's frame, though those are luckily not used anymore). This is useful when you have a limited number of shells available, but not only then.\n\nAnother big advantage is that tmux allows you to keep programs running in the background that bind to a terminal. Sounds complicated, but let me explain what it means in practice. An executable you run from the shell will, by default if it doesn't do things to avoid it, bind to that terminal. That means if the terminal terminates / closes, the program terminates with it. However, there are situations where you don't want that, especially for long-running processes. To give an example: I have an encoding job in `ffmpeg` that takes multiple hours. I started it and now I want to close my session for whatever reason. However, if you close your session, your terminal terminates with it and your encoding stops. If you run that command in a tmux session, it will persist your logoff and keep running in the background and you can re-attach to your tmux session any time to see the progress of your encoding job.\n\nThe other solution that you see sometimes is to run a command with an `&` at the end. This will make the process run in the background also; however you then have no easy way to reattach and interact with that process directly.\n\nThere are a lot of great resources about `tmux` on the internet, so I'm not going into details here. My rule of thumb for using tmux is:\n\n1. Use it locally when you have a job that needs to run in the background\n2. Use it remote always (exceptions apply)\n\n### OpenSSH\n`ssh` is the secure shell. What does it do? Everything honestly. You've probably used it to connect to another computer running it or know that it can do that. What else can it do for you? Frankly the name is a bit limiting as in fact, `ssh` offers more than just a shell. It can also act as a protocol to transfer files using the SFTP protocol securely over an insecure network. Other applications can use it to secure their connections, for example `rsync`. It can act as a SOCKS proxy. It has a lot of uses that might help you to get a task done.\n\nOne example to show its versatility: I was in a hotel with my notebook and Raspberry Pi. I wanted to hook up the Raspberry Pi to the TV and use it to watch something over WiFi. The WiFi however had a login page for internet access and the Raspberry Pi no browser or peripherals and I wasn't willing to get either. So what did I do? I connected to the Raspberry Pi using `ssh` opening a SOCKS proxy (in this case the command is `ssh -D 9999 $ip-address`, then you set your SOCKS proxy in your browser to \"localhost:9999\" and browse a site. The network sees the Raspberry Pi requesting a website on the internet and presents you with the login page that is then delivered to your local browser. You accept the terms and the gateway now sees that the Raspberry Pi has accepted, whitelisting its MAC address and granting it internet access.\n\n`ssh` is great especially when combined with `tmux`. You can just connect to a remote server, start a tmux session by running `tmux`, do some stuff, detach from the tmux session, disconnect from the server, reconnect later, reattach the tmux session and everything is just as you left it plus any new output from running commands, if applicable. You can even do so in a manner that the session is started and re-attached to automatically on connecting.\n\nIt is an awesome tool, but don't forget to secure it as it can allow access to your machine.\n\n### Task Spooler\nOne of the lesser known tools and maybe not helpful for many, Task Spooler helps you to run multiple shell commands after each other (or in parallel). The normal flow for a shell you might see is \"command 1 & command 2 & command 3\" which will run those commands after each other. But what if you don't know all the commands yet? Task spooler allows you to queue commands at any time, shuffle them around, change their running conditions (e.g. only run command if command with number 3 exited successfully) and more. I use it mostly to manage encoding jobs.\n\n### find\n`find` is a tool for finding files using a plethora of criteria. It allows you to search for things like \"files that have a certain age and are bigger than 4 GB\" or whatever you might have in mind. In addition to just listing you those files, `find` also allows you to run a certain command on those files, either individually or on all of them in one go.\n    \nIf you don't need all the fancy knobs of `find`, `fd` is a faster and easier alternative.\n    \n### ffmpeg\n`ffmpeg` is basically the command line glue for all the multimedia codecs you have on your system. Firstly, it provides a lot of codecs by itself - in fact it's basically *the* project that developed most open source media codec implementations. It can, however, also use libraries from other projects, which is mostly interesting for encoding as `ffmpeg`'s focus is not necessarily in depth, but breadth, which isn't a bad thing. It is an incredibly versatile tool to convert any media file to most relevant ones, though the quality of open source AAC encoders is lacking; however, I suggest avoiding it in general and go with OPUS, if possible.\n\n### rsync\nAlso one of the better-known tools, `rsync` is a tool that synchronizes files between two locations. What makes `rsync` so powerful are its delta algorithm to reduce transfer size and the transfer options. You can choose how the files are to be created on the receiving side, if the transfer should be done over SSH, if only newer files should be transfered, which mode they should be created in etc. It is the command line tool of choice  for any general purpose data synchronization need like backups.\n\n### sed\nThe Stream EDitor transforms text. Sounds boring, but can be a very helpful tool. Silly example: I have a file called `test.txt` I want to post on reddit as code. Now I *could* use the editor and just select the lines I post, but that doesn't really convey the usefulness, so I'm going to do it my way and get the content of my file ready to post here from the command line:\n\n    $ sed 's|^|    |' < test.txt\n    this is a line\n    another one\n    one more?\n    let's keep going\n    is this enough?\n    running out of ideas\n    anyhow\n    it doesn't matter\n    this line contains running as well\n    end\n\nThis basically told `sed` to replace (or substitute, hence the \"s\") the beginning of each line it receives with four spaces, which it will then print to its standard output.\n\n### grep\nKind of related, `grep` takes input and outputs only the lines that match the filter criteria we gave it. To only print lines that start with \"running\":\n\n    $ grep '^running' < test.txt\n    running out of ideas\n\n### rename\nProbably you know that renaming individual files is done using the `mv` command. However, a dedicated command for renaming files exists. It is useful when you want to rename multiple files at once. A common example is that you have numbered files, say img1.jpg, img2.jpg, … img9.jpg, img10.jpg and so forth. Now the sorting here becomes a challenge because a shell might thing that img10.jpg comes after img1.jpg and before img2.jpg which is understandable and maybe even correct, but most certainly not what you want. `rename` helps with that. If you have less than a hundred files, this would fix your file names:\n\n    $ rename img img0 img?.jpg\nThis translates to \"rename img to img0 in all files that start with img followed by a single character followed by .jpg\", so **img**1.jpg would become **img0**1.jpg, but img10.jpg stays the same because it has two characters after \"img\" and before \".jpg\".\n\nBe aware that two versions of `rename` exists, a simple one in C that is part of `util-linux` and a more powerful one written in Perl which supports Regular Expressions. The example I provided works in both though.\n\n### Regular Expressions \nRegular Expressions or regex is a powerful system to match text. In fact it is so powerful that I don't think many have fully mastered it. and I am no exception - in fact my regex knowledge sucks. However, if you go back to the `sed` and `grep` example, the argument given there contains a regular expression, the `^` which translates to \"beginning of line\". This is certainly one of the easier ones, but Regular Expressions can become very complex, allowing you to match and transform text in a manner never experienced before ;)\n\n### curl\n`curl` is a tool to download things in a non-interactive way. It is, in my opinion, the best one to use in scripts.\n\n### Your shell\nYour shell is a tool to combine all the programs you have and make them do your bidding. It allows to be scripted for that matter and provides some logic itself. There are good shell scripting tutorials online and I suggest that you learn the basics (loops, conditional statements, general flow) as this is quite simple programming that can help to achieve some tasks.\n\n#Conclusion\nAs you noticed, this post doesn't really help with concrete problems, but this was not my goal. I hope to give a small overview of the tools you probably have installed on your system because for me as a beginner, it's not only that you don't know how a certain program works, but also that you don't even know it exists. Also, believe it or not, the shell and shell programs are tools to make your life easier, not harder, and after working with shell programs for some time, you'll most likely notice that they do what you want much better than most graphical programs. For sure not everything can be done efficiently in a shell, but a lot of tasks can. It requires some experience to analyze the problem you have into smaller sub-problems that you solve with the tools you have and combine using shell logic, but your tools are flexible and in my opinion, it's actually fun.\n\nIf you need help on a given program, your first step should always be to run `man $application`, e.g. `man rename` which would explain the `rename` program including a slightly more complex version of the example I gave (meaning more than 100 files). If you try and you're not getting anywhere, feel free to ask, but always try to solve it yourself first.", "output": "First thing first is be a clicker; Linux the GUI environment, just click on everything.

I have little prior experience with Linux, but I'm a reasonably technically savvy person in general; I do some personal web development and have set up simple Linux VPSs, know how to use the command line, etc.\n\nI saw Ubuntu recommended as the most polished and beginner-friendly distro, so I went with that. It has not gone well. A brief list of issues I've encountered:\n\n\\* There's some bug with Nvida graphics cards that causes noticeable mouse lag on my second monitor, along with freezes whenever I do something that's graphics-intensive.\n\n\\* Even with no second monitor in use, sometimes Ubuntu will just randomly freeze while I'm playing a game.\n\n\\* Sometimes when I close the laptop and reopen it, it has crashed.\n\n\\* Ubuntu's recommended browser of Firefox is extremely slow at some tasks, practically unusable. I tried switching to Chrome, but Chrome has its own intermittent freezes, and there's some bug where a tab can get \"stuck\" while I'm moving it and prevent me from continuing to move it.\n\n\\* There's a bug that causes my mouse to get stuck when I move it from one display to the other if it's too close to the top of the screen.\n\n\\* I had hoped that moving to Linux would give me more customization options, but it appears the breadth of tools available is quite poor. For example I was looking for a simple backup utility that would function similarly to Time Machine on Mac, and it appears there are none. Reading old threads on other people asking for the same thing, I see a bunch of Linux users recommending things that are not similar at all, or saying \"oh you can easily emulate that by writing your own bash script\". Like, sure, I am capable of doing that, but when users are having to write their own solutions to simple tasks it's obvious that the existing app repository is insufficient for its core purpose. I also tried to find a simple image-editing program like Preview on Mac, and there was nothing; I can either pick between Gimp with its extremely high learning curve or various other programs that are covered in visual bugs and can't even do something like \"drag corner to resize image\".\n\n\\* Opening Steam can take more than 30 seconds, and then I have to wait another 30+ seconds for an actual game to open. Even opening the terminal sometimes forces me to wait for multiple seconds.\n\n\\* Most concerningly of all, it appears that the Snap store has no human review, and [frequently contains malware](https://forum.level1techs.com/t/malware-in-the-snap-store-again/208817)? And that Canonical claims that individual Snaps are sandboxed, but this is actually not true, and even a \"strict mode\" snap can [run a system-wide keylogger](https://www.aquasec.com/blog/snap-trap-the-hidden-dangers-within-ubuntus-package-suggestion-system)? Frankly: what the *hell* guys?\n\nAnd all of this in less than a week. I can only imagine how many more issues I would discover in the years that I would like to use this laptop.\n\nLike, I'm really trying here. I love the ethos behind open-source, and I'm willing to do a bit of extra config work and suffer through some minor inconveniences to use Linux as my default OS. (I didn't mention the dozens of more minor issues I've come across while trying to get my system set up.) But as it currently stands, it just doesn't feel like Linux (or at least Ubuntu) is actually ready for practical use as a desktop environment by people who want to spend their time doing things other than debugging Linux issues.\n\nHave I just had a uniquely bad experience here? Maybe some of these are hardware issues, I should buy a new computer, switch to a different distro, and try again? Or is this just the best that's to be expected from the Linux ecosystem right now, and I should suck it up and buy another overpriced Macbook?

{"id": "ir9l0r", "instruction": "The truth about learning-adverse people struggling with Linux", "input": "Lately there's been an insurgence of threads attacking Linux users for being \"unhelpful\" when it comes to providing assistance. I felt like providing some much needed counterbalance by explaining some things to hopefully improve the situation, create a singular point of discussion and probably making myself into this subs biggest nightmare.  Here's my take on the story from the side of a \"more experienced\" Linux user, take it as you will.\n\nWhat do I mean when I call myself experienced? I've been using Arch as a daily driver for nearly 8 years now. I'm at the point where I run i3wm with 35 shortcuts, about a quarter of those leading to self-written bash scripts. I'm not a terminal junkie, I still use GUI's where it's appropriate to use one: Simple notes, reading mail and system configurations are easier done through a terminal. On the other side using Firefox as a browser, openOffice for any form of word processing and various other specialized programs for specialized usecases is to me the best way to make use of my computer. So the terminal users who still use some sort of spawn of 123 to do their spreadsheets are weird to me as well and I really wonder how much more productive they can be when they're basically forcing their terminal to act as a graphical environment. I digress.\n\nThe road to getting where I am now has been painful and has involved a lot of hours of me  reading documentation and wiki pages for sometimes even the most minute things that I would probably only use once in a bash script, ever. At the same time I've - forcefully sometimes - had to learn a lot about how the Linux kernel works,  how a distribution builds on top of that and all the way up to eventually writing scripts in different languages to do the things that I need done on a computer. Gradually but surely I've learned to use the terminal for more and more things over the course of those 8 years. At some point I'm going to have to consider myself somewhere beyond the point of a beginner - the exact reason for which  I originally joined this sub  - and take a step forward on behalf of all the people who are still greater than me, who are rapidly leaving this place due to the schism that's being torn between experienced and non-experienced users.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of brand-new Linux users taking a whole different route when it comes to learning about how to best use their operating system. In fact, what I'm seeing is a bunch of users who are seemingly extremely adverse towards developing any sort of knowledge at all. Most of you folk seem very eager to do so and that's absolutely fine - no problem with you. My problem lies with the people who seem to want things explained to them in a manner that is not going to help them forward in the long term. The folk who think that having a pretty graphical interface for everything is absolutely necessary and who seemingly can't live without them. Who will cry and moan at anyone who provides them three lines of terminal input to do the thing that they need done instead of pointing them through six menus to get to the specific window they need to change said setting. Obviously if you come from a Windows world this is where your comfort zone is at, but let me explain a few things about graphical applications first before I destroy your aspirations to have Linux become the next Windows at the snap of your fingers.\n\nGraphical interfaces in the broad term can range from being useful to extremely clunky  Here's the six main problems I personally have with graphical interfaces:\n\n* Most developers have very different ideas over how you should design them which makes one interface look and behave a lot different from another.\n* They generally have a longer and therefor slower development cycle due to the need of adding graphical elements for any sort of functionally, making updating them with new stuff slower than needed.\n* Let's not even start talking about that one, singular update that completely flips the design around and suddenly the entire interface is completely different from what you were once used to.\n* They take up more disk space not only due to graphical data, but also due to requiring libraries to render those interfaces.\n* They spend more of your time, RAM and system resources to get them to draw to the screen.\n* For simple things they are often just a pain in the ass to deal with.\n\nThis, among other reasons, is why people will usually tell you it's easier to change your resolution through a terminal application like xrandr rather than your window manager's supposed interface. Because it  saves you time, effort and resources doing so. Does that mean you might have to learn a thing or two about a \"scary terminal application\", taking the time to read a manual or wiki page about it and figuring out how to apply it for your intended use? Yes.  Afterwards though you'll know the exact line of arguments to use for your specific usecase. Whenever you need more out of that application you can just throw up the documentation and have a much better understanding of how to use said application thanks to your newly found experience, hence having an easier time with the documentation and better yet - other applications that work in a similar fashion. At a certain point you'll find that you can guess the arguments to a new tool you've discovered without needing the documentation for it at all. That's when you start realizing just how useful Linux can be, because now you're becoming proficient enough to actually not need the documentation that much anymore.\n\nIn comparison, what are you learning by using a visual interface? Not that much really. Where to find the specific setting in the specific environment that you're currently using. Move to another and you might have to relearn the location of just about everything. Not to mention if they roll out an update completely changing the look and feel of your precious interfaces. And then again. And then once more. This rarely ever happens on terminal applications but is a near given on any form of GUI application. Remember when people lost their shit because Microsoft implemented a ribbon in Word? That's the level of bullshit you'll never have to deal with when using terminal-based applications. In a certain sense, terminal applications are actually a lot easier to use once you get through the initial \"black screen of horrors\" phase because you have a certain guarantee things will, for the most part, always work the same way regardless of what version of the application you're using.\n\nNow on to the next problem which is pretty much sourced from having issues with the problem mentioned above: Learning is not a bad thing. I can understand if you're an businessman and genuinely don't have the time to dig through manual pages for one tidbit of information, but for most people who are still very new to using a computer (even if you've been using Windows for nearly a decade) it's going to be a part of your development process to do so. It's not a bad thing to become proficient at computer usage if that's what you seemingly need  to actually use a Linux machine properly.\n\nThink about it like this: You didn't mind crawling around as a baby to get to where you needed to be. At a certain point though your parents did some real effort on your behalf to teach you how to properly use those two legs you were born with though. Aren't you happier at this point having been through the process of learning to walk and getting to where you need to be much faster? In fact being able to walk has opened the door to so many new modes of transportation: Cycling, catching the bus and eventually being able to drive. Now you're starting to get ahead in life and never once consider how much painstaking effort it once cost you to learn how to even walk.\n\nThe same kind of thing could be said about learning to use Linux. The problem most of you are struggling with is that Windows has never let you learn to walk on your own and has carried you through nearly everything. That's why Linux feels like such a hard environment for you to adapt to since having to stand on your own two legs also causes you you to occasionally fall on the floor and wipe your GRUB installation. Growing pains in the endless cycle of human development that nearly everyone on earth struggles with and that no matter who you are you are not exempt from experiencing. Why should learning a new operating system be any different?\n\nThe neat thing about Linux however, is that everything you mess up you can also fix yourself too. There's almost never a situation where you are forced to reinstall your entire system, save from your harddisk erupting into flames. Are there going to be situations that are too hard for you to deal with given your current level of experience? Yes. And that's the exact reason why we have communities full of kind, and less kind, people who are willing to help you out, miles of documentation and a myriad of other ways of learning for you to make use of.\n\nSo when you tell off someone who's taking the time to explain to you  that you'll need to open a terminal and input a bunch of stuff just to get to where you need to be, pointing you to where you can read about the specific bit of information that you need in your specific usecase or trying to explain to you that Linux just works differently, try to acknowledge to yourself first that the person you're dealing with has most likely gone through the same resources you have and is not trying to be any better than you. If they sound snobbish or rude to you perhaps consider that said person has already explained the exact same thing to a hundred different others, is perhaps not having the best of days or is generally just not that well-suited for providing help. Yet here they are still doing so and yet you act as if you are deserving of special treatment that not even they, nor anyone, ever had.\n\nNobody nowhere in life is being carried on hands and knees and talked to like the little princess they expect to be. People struggle with problems bigger than their disk not mounting in the proper location. Perhaps the very same people that are now willingly trying to teach you how to blacklist kernel modules without the need of a graphical interface. The same people you think are rotten because they won't adhere to your extremely high standards of user-friendliness and point you to the easiest window to do so. The Linux community in general is full of knowledgeable odd-balls that have somewhere in life prioritized learning Linux over becoming social workers adapt at dealing with spoiled people. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the exact reason why at a certain point you are all going to be told to *read the fucking manual.* Because somewhere down the line all of us had to, and on such a wonderful day like today it might as well be your bloody turn to do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMostly finished, expect minor changes to happen as I further develop myself into being a better writer.", "output": "Linux evangelists often oversell it.

Recommending a rolling release distribution is one thing, but recommending a BROKEN rolling release distro is a totally different thing!!\n\nWhy is Manjaro broken?\n\n1. Some people say Manjaro is just Arch with a GUI installer. Well, Manjaro maintains a separate repository which is not in sync with Arch’s main repositories, which means Manjaro is not *just* Arch.[https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Manjaro:\\_A\\_Different\\_Kind\\_of\\_Beast](https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Manjaro:_A_Different_Kind_of_Beast)\n\n2. They are \"testing\" packages by delaying them for a week. This is not \"testing\" at all.\n\n3. They delay packages in their repos, but not the packages in the AUR, so if a package in AUR is updated and relies on a package (let's say - a library or something) in the main repos that also should be up-to-date (but isn't, because Manjaro held it back), then You will have problems.\n\n4. Manjaro let their SSL certificates expire not once, but twice! The first time, they asked the users to use a private window and/or change the system time. The second time when the SSL certificates expired, they did the same.\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20150409095421/https://manjaro.github.io/expired\\_SSL\\_certificate/](https://web.archive.org/web/20150409095421/https://manjaro.github.io/expired_SSL_certificate/) & [https://web.archive.org/web/20160528135123/http://manjaro.github.io/SSL-Certificate-Expired/](https://web.archive.org/web/20160528135123/http://manjaro.github.io/SSL-Certificate-Expired/)\n\n5. Manjaro provides an easy way to install packages from the AUR via their GUI-based package manager \\`pamac\\` (which also had it's own problems [https://gitlab.manjaro.org/applications/pamac/issues/719](https://gitlab.manjaro.org/applications/pamac/issues/719)). This is a major security issue considering that packages in AUR are NOT checked by Arch Linux maintainers (and Manjaro does not maintain its own either). Some AUR packages were found to be malware in the past. So think about a Linux noob (Manjaro’s target demographic are not really power users) installing a harmless-looking AUR package that could potentially mess their system!\n\nMy experience with AUR was not good, but also not terrible. If You know what You're doing, then You \\*probably\\* will be fine. But here is a thing: most noobs don't know what they are doing! Granted, this does not apply to all people that are new to Linux, but You get the idea...\n\n\n\nSo, You may ask: \"What do You suggest instead of Manjaro?\"  \nWell, a few things.\n\nDo not use a rolling release distro, if You don't have a good reason to do so.

Instead use regular distros, like:\n\n\nPop!\\_OS ( [https://system76.com/pop](https://system76.com/pop) )  \n\n\n\\* they have an ISO with ACTIVE NVIDIA driver's builtin. So, it boots the LiveISO with the NVIDIA's proprietary drivers & if Your NVIDIA card is working in the LiveISO, then it will work on bare metal 99% of the time.  \n\n\\* if You like GNOME, this is the distro You should use! In my opinion it's the best GNOME implementation I have ever seen. Dunno why, but GNOME on other distros is unusable for me.\n\n\nor openSUSE Leap. ( [https://www.opensuse.org/](https://www.opensuse.org/) )  \n\n\n\\*YaST is amazing, You can configure everything with - from the basic stuff like sound or printers to the bootloader and Linux kernel itself ( [https://yast.opensuse.org/](https://yast.opensuse.org/) )  \n\n\\*it's documentation is really good, not as complete as Arch Wiki, but it's really well written and some of the stuff there also applies to other distros as well ( [https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Documentation](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Documentation) )  \n\n\\*OBS is great - it's kinda like AUR in Arch, but I had much better experience with it, than with AUR. You can access it via GUI ( [https://software.opensuse.org/](https://software.opensuse.org/) ) or with CLI via \\`opi\\`. I recommend only using it, if You really need it!  \n\n\\*\\`snapper\\` and \\`btrfs\\` are Your saviours, when You will mess with Your system. Instead of reinstalling or trying to fix the issue, You can use \\`snapper\\` to 'rollback' to a previous working system snapshot. You can also install a GRUB addon (\\`grub2-snapper-plugin\\` - from my not-so-long research no other distro has this feature!) to be able to boot the system directly from a certain snapshot! ( [https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Snapper](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Snapper) )\n\n\\* OpenQA, which is a automated testing service to ensure packages will not screw up your system. Thanks, u/VortexAcherontic 😀\n\n\n\\*NOTE:\\* Unlike Ubuntu and Pop!\\_OS, You have to install multimedia codecs and NVIDIA drivers manually, but it's not really hard, everything is explained here:[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Install\\_Packman\\_codecs](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Install_Packman_codecs)[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:NVIDIA\\_drivers](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:NVIDIA_drivers)\n\n\n\n Ubuntu MATE is also a fine choice (I started on this one, it's a really good starting point -- [https://ubuntu-mate.org/](https://ubuntu-mate.org/) ).  \n\n\\* well, it's Ubuntu, there is nothing more to say  \n\n\\* MATE is lighter than GNOME, thus Ubuntu MATE is lighter than \"default\" Ubuntu with GNOME  \n\n\\* it has the \"Software Boutique\", an App Store with curated list of apps, considered by many people as the best of the best in their respective categories, so new users don't really have to worry about which app to use to do what they want  \n\n\\* Ubuntu (and thus, Ubuntu MATE) now ships with NVIDIA drivers (but they aren't active like in Pop!\\_OS), so it's one less thing You need to care about as a noob\n\n\n\nBut now You may ask: \"What if I REALLY WANT to use a rolling release distro or my hardware is unsupported by regular ones?\"  \n\nI'm glad You asked!\n\nThe most obvious answer pepole would give You is to just use plain Arch. And it's a good recommendation, but it's not really a distro suitable for a Linux beginner. Instead, I would recommend one distro: openSUSE Tumbleweed. I've mentioned some of the reasons already, when I was talking about openSUSE Leap.\n\n\nBut why Tumbleweed? ( [https://www.opensuse.org/](https://www.opensuse.org/) )  \n\n\\* Because it IS really stable, I'm using it for more than a year now and I had no problems with it. I have thrown various stuff at it, like flatpaks, snaps, untested \\`.rpms\\` from OBS or github/gitlab, some strange \\`.appimages\\` and all kind of Python or Node.js packages. It was (and still is) REALLY stable.\n\n\\* The installation is comprehensive, but also really easy to do!\\* The installer allows You to really customize Your system - You can make it as minimal as Arch, or as \"bloated\" as You want. You can select what will be installed on Your system \\*\\*\\*package-by-package\\*\\*\\*. No other installer (aside from Arch or Gentoo, obviously) allows for this kind of customization out-of-the-box! You can onfigure bootloader and dual-boot settings, kernel parameters, CPU mitigations settings and more.  \n\n\\* You can install stuff like Steam or DIscord, when installing the system, so they will be available right after first boot!  \n\n\\* OBS is great - it's kinda like AUR in Arch, but I had much better experience with it, than with AUR. You can access it via GUI ( [https://software.opensuse.org/](https://software.opensuse.org/) ) or with CLI via \\`opi\\`. I recommend only using it, if You really need it!  \n\n\\* And even if something bad happens (I DIDN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS with openSUSE, but You never know...), You can always use \\`snapper\\` to 'rollback' to a previous working system snapshot and this is really useful in a rolling release distro - granted, this isn't exclusive to openSUSE, but openSUSE has two nice things related to it:\n\n1. \\`yast2-snapper\\` - GUI-based fronted to \\`snapper\\` which allows for easy snapshot management, like creating, changing & deleting them, to save some disk space.\n2. \\`grub2-snapper-plugin\\` - which allows You to boot the system from a previous working snapshot! From my not-so-long research no other distro has this feature!\n\n\\*NOTE:\\* Unlike Ubuntu and Pop!\\_OS, You have to install multimedia codecs and NVIDIA drivers manually, but it's not really hard, everything is explained here:  \n[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Install\\_Packman\\_codecs](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Install_Packman_codecs)  \n[https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:NVIDIA\\_drivers](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:NVIDIA_drivers)\n\nIs there something that is wrong here?\n\nSomething You disagree with?\n\nFine, let me know!", "output": "If your point is that people who have no linux experience and no coding experience shouldn't start with Manjaro, then sure, maybe start with something easier and more accessible until you learn the basics. But your reasons why Manjaro is \"broken\" are bullshit tbh. \n\n1. Yes Manjaro is not Arch. What's your point? Why does that make it broken? Nobody pretends that Manjaro is Arch, but obviously it's based on Arch and is similar in many ways. There's nothing wrong with saying it's like Arch. Because it literally is.\n2. ([from the forum](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/what-is-the-testing-branch/50487)) **\"Testing:** packages get moved from Manjaro unstable to testing in bulk once in a while (usually once for a few days) and then announcement shows on Manjaro forum. If packages don’t pass the test, they get withhold or sometimes re-compiled, removed, etc.\" So yes, they actually test their packages. They wait a week, and they test their packages. This is wrong.\n3. Manjaro users have access to AUR but these are not Manjaro packages. These are literally user repositories. If Manjaro devs managed the AUR, it would not be the AUR. I've been using Manjaro daily for 3 years and never experienced this issue when installing from the AUR. It's certainly possible, but you can always manually install the packages you need if you can't wait for the Manjaro update.\n4. Sure, that happened. Four years ago. It hasn't happened since. I would understand if this was an ongoing and/or current issue, but it is not.\n5. I agree Pamac isn't perfect. But, not perfect =/= broken. I'm sure I could point to dozens of minor flaws in the distros you recommend instead of Manjaro. Using this to say it's broken is pretty dishonest. And again you are criticizing the AUR. Once again, they are user repositories, not official repositories. Regarding the malware, yes it was found, but the changes [were in fact reversed,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malware-found-in-arch-linux-aur-package-repository/) contrary to your implication in this point. Malware was also found in Ubuntu repositories, so this is far from unique to Manjaro.\n\nPoint is, just like every linux distro on the planet, there are some problems with Manjaro. But is it *broken?* Definitely not. \n\nIs Manjaro a good choice for linux newbies? Depends on how much time you're willing to put into learning it, and how much coding experience you have. It's honestly not that demanding to learn, but if you need something to set and forget, it might not be the best choice. On the other hand, it's very rewarding to learn how to customize your system"}

That is not something a program or script can just do on its own. \n\nWindows later did something similar by having a popup that no program is allowed to interact with, it needs you to click OK to proceed.   \nSudo is pretty much same thing only its asking for the password of a user who have rights to act on behalf of root. Which is what sudo is - it stands for \"Super User DO\".  Its essentially equivalent to \"The king orders\" Which is also why it doesnt tell you that it did what you asked. If it doesnt throw up any errors then it did what you asked it to. And if you asked it to burn your system then thats what it did.  With great powers and so on..."}

What does it do?\n\nIn terminal activities and some shell scripts, the '|' symbol is used to connect one process to another, sort of like a pipe connecting two streams. So it's called a 'pipe'.\n\nHere's an example. If I say:\n\n    $ for n in {1..10}; do echo $RANDOM; done\n\n     20034\n     24315\n     12703\n     22240\n     10073\n     18561\n     20058\n     5761\n     8550\n     12705\n\nThis prints a list of 10 random numbers. But suppose I want the list sorted -- I add a pipe and a sort command:\n\n    $ for n in {1..10}; do echo $RANDOM; done | sort -n\n\n     5761\n     8550\n     10073\n     12703\n     12705\n     18561\n     20034\n     20058\n     22240\n     24315\n\nSo my original random-generating routine's output is delivered to the pipe, which serves as the input to 'sort'. One can say the numbers are 'piped' to a separate process. This piping method can be repeated as often as necessary, and one can use this to build complex and sophisticated sequences of commands."}
{"id": "kej2fk", "instruction": "Part 2 of \"Want to move to Linux from Windows but need advice\" thread, a follow up", "input": "Hello everyone, I was requested to make a follow up to [my previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/kbdax5/want_to_move_to_linux_from_windows_but_need_advice/) where I sought advice about migrating to Linux from Windows 10 and I ended up with over a hundred comments, it was pretty crazy how much advice I got and Im really grateful for it. Im already on Linux atm and its been relatively smooth so far, Im having a lot of fun getting used to it.\n\nI decided on Pop!\\_OS as my first Linux distro, in a dual boot setup with Windows 10. Tbh I wanted to nuke Windows but the possibility of certain programs/games not working made me feel like I should keep Windows just in case. I bought a new SSD that was at a decent price with the intention of using it for Linux exclusively, it was kind of a pain in the ass getting the drive and the cables as I couldnt get them delivered from the store I bought them from and actually installing the drive was a huge pain in the ass because my PC's power supply is non-modular so I had to change the layout of all my drives and the cable management to fit them in, and it was also annoying finding the screws that came with the case to mount them.\n\nNext I initialised the drives, and I initialised it as GPT not knowing that would be an issue, I would later have to change that. I made a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/pop_os/comments/kdv4iq/how_to_install_on_a_new_ssd_drive/) on the Pop!\\_OS subreddit and ended up getting some really good help, but long story short I followed [this videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4BlW9rH8WA) instructions and had very few issues with installing Pop!\\_OS.\n\nAfter setting up my profile and all that jazz I started installing things from the Pop Shop, no issues there and a fair few of the applications I use were just on there. Pop shop seems kinda laggy but on the whole it was really easy to use. I was afraid the impression I had of the pop shop represented Pop!\\_OS as a whole but it was surprisingly very smooth, it feels really snappy compared to Windows for sure.\n\nI did have a few issues installing NordVPN and Brave Browser today but after some searching and following instructions I figured it out eventually. I feel like hackerman every time I do anything in the terminal lol. Ive basically been spending all of today messing around with stuff, setting up my accounts and tweaking things, and just testing how I felt doing everyday tasks. Tbh it feels really great and Ive actually found it quite fun just using whereas Windows always just feels bloated and frustrating to me, personally. I had an audio issue but I fixed it pretty easily, other than that Ive had no issues at all. I also followed an article on the System76 to customise my dock, I installed Dash to Dock and made my dock resemble the one in MacOS and Im pretty pleased with the results, I feel like Im slowly making Pop!\\_OS my own.\n\nI havent yet set up a virtual machine because Im pretty unfamiliar with that, but Im in no hurry atm. I did install Steam and Lutris from the Pop Shop but I havent tested any of my games so far, so that may be the part three thread maybe. Ive also only been using it for a day so far so not enough time to really have a full impression of things, Im also trying to look for some guides on what I should do on my new install just to make sure Im not doing anything wrong.\n\nBut yeah overall its been really good, Im really glad I made the jump and even though Im very new to everything the ease for which I can reach out and get help and advice makes me feel really confident about my decision. If anyone else was in the same boat as me I recommend they give it a try for sure because even though I did a dual boot I dont particularly feel like I miss anything from Windows atm.", "output": "Looks like your doing well!

I understand that is for getting a quicker answer but at the same time if makes more difficult for the ones that we are active in all these subs to give answers and the replies are spread around. Lately what I’m doing is copying pasting the same reply in all their questions but I don’t think is the best way either.\n\nOther users do not explain anything at all… is the kind of post that says something like: help! Urgent! Or any other thing with exclamation marks plus something that is not very relevant to be able to fix it. I think in the rules it should be mandatory to provide hardware information, log information, what was the user trying to do,… because those are the main questions we need to ask over and over again.\n\nWith the rise of internet now the difference on your computer resources usage (for most of the users) will be achieved by the number of tabs open on the browser. Is true that Linux can use less resources than windows on idle but as soon as you start opening tabs on your browser the difference is not as substantial. \nWith that said. Having 4gb of ram in 2022, unless you go for a “server” mode without X or with very limited use of it, will give you the same problems in all the operating systems, windows, Mac or Linux and you’ll need to do sacrifices in all them. Linux is good but cannot make miracles. That also mean that most of the Linux distros are mostly very similar… it changes the look and feel, the package manager, the number of packages available or installed and sometimes the init system. Asking for which distro is good for you bring the same answers over and over again… and there is even a subreddit for it!!\n\nLinux has a pretty good support for old hardware but old does not mean ancient… I’m reading many posts with really old hardware that I understand that someone told to OP that Linux will make a miracle on it… maybe… but again sacrifices need to be done and if nvidia (for example) does not support your ancient graphic card… how can the Linux developers?\n\nAppreciate your time (and other’s time!)! If the effort to fix something is 10 hours and you spend this 10 hours learning something that can make you more competitive to find a job… think that this job might be able to pay you for 10 hours of work enough to renew your ancient hardware… (10 for saying a number!). I understand personal challenges and that we all can be stubborn but… you’re not only using your time but the time of many volunteers that are here helping.\n\nThis is not a ranting post (or at least is not my intention!). I want to help but I want also to improve the outcome of our help. \n\nHelp us to help you. Provide us with information. Tell us what you were doing, how, when and on what. Give us hardware info, distro name and version… that will help enormously!! And finally… consider if what you’re trying to achieve is worth your time and other’s time.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nP.S.= English is not my mother tongue.

A kernel is the lowest level of software that interfaces with the hardware in your computer. It's the bridge between GNU and the hardware.\n\nDesktop environment??  A collection of GUI applications are referred to as a desktop environment or DE. This is things like a menu, icons, toolbars wallpaper, widgets, and windows manager. Some DEs take more system resources to run http://www.renewablepcs.com/about-linux/kde-gnome-or-xfce. Most end users don't care too much about the DE, GNU, or Kernel, they really only care about the applications like games, email, word processor etcetera. So how to get started with the migration?\n\n---------\n\n**The Migration.**\n\n- run a backup & - migrate users' data from the old OS to the new OS\n\n- select a distribution\n\n- download the ISO\n\n- verify the hash of the ISO (aside from security, this also will detect a corrupted download)\n\n- burn the ISO to CD and/or load it onto a USB stick/drive (to do this, try YUMI http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/ or UNetbootin http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/- more here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tools_to_create_Live_USB_systems )\n\n- do a test boot with a LiveCD if possible (optional, recommended)\n\n- install the new OS\n\n- configure/install any missing drivers/troubleshooting etc\n\n- select/install software\n\n---------\n\n**THE BACKUP**\nEven if you toast your machine, you will be able to recover your data. If your backup software has a \"verify\" feature, use it. You'll want to backup to an external device, if possible. Do NOT back up your data onto your existing C: drive, as if you somehow delete your C: drive during installation of Linux, your backup will be deleted too.\nMove things to an external Drive/USB stick or a cloud account (note: the Downloads, Music, My Pictures, My Videos collections sub directories may be VERY large).\nWhat to back up? Well you aren't going to be able to run windows programs on Linux (well you can but that's another story see WINE) so there is no need to back them up, but you will want things like documents, pictures, movies, music and things of that nature.  Unfortunately some of these can be hard to find in Windows. Things like emails, browser profile/bookmarks.\n\n- Things on the Desktop are actually located at C:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\Desktop **or** %USERPROFILE%\\Desktop\n\n- Favorites (Internet Explorer)\tC:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\Favorites **or** %USERPROFILE%\\Favorites \n\n- The My Documents folder is C:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\My Documents **or** %USERPROFILE%\\Documents\n\n- %USERPROFILE%\\Music   **&** %USERPROFILE%\\Video  **&** %USERPROFILE%\\Pictures\n\n- Email. Microsoft likes to move these around from version to version.  http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/21384/where-is-my-pst-file-and-how-can-i-move-it-somewhere-else/\n\n- Contacts (Outlook Express)\tC:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Address Book\n\n- Contacts (Outlook)\t - Address book is contained in a PST file    2010 click the file tab>account settings>account settings> data tab>click an entry>click open folder location usually C:\\users\\username\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Outlook  **or** %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\n\n- 2013/16 C:\\users\\username\\Documents\\Outlook Files\n\n- email (Outlook Express)\tC:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\Identities\\XXXXX\\Microsoft\\Outlook Express (where XXXXX is a long string of alphanumeric characters)\n\n- email (Outlook 2003)\tC:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Outlook\n\n- Getting things out of a PST file is another thing all together. A utility like readpst will be needed. For contacts or vcards importing 1 by 1 is simply enough but for bulk import you will need to open a terminal and type some commands.\n\n- - $ cat ./* >> mycontacts.vcf\n\n- - $ sed -i 's/VCARDBEGIN/VCARD\\n\\nBEGIN/g' mycontacts.vcf\n\n- - Then import the mycontacts.vcf into the particular program you are using. Thunderbird or Claws or something else.\n\nThis is a short list for a few programs. You should make a list of the programs you use and the file types that result and confirm their location. Keep in mind some Microsoft formats are proprietary and may not be able to be transferred to another program. Some can be but sometimes the markup used is proprietary so the content of a word doc for instance may be there but the spacing or special columns might not be, or a particular font might be and a substitution might be made.\n\nEach user on a Windows XP machine has a separate profile, these are all stored in the C:\\Documents and Settings directory. Ensure to copy the data for each profile on the system that you want to create on the Linux system.\nSome directories (eg. Application Data) may be hidden, to browse to them, first enable \"show hidden files and folders\" (http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/show-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-vista/). \n\n\n**Migration tips:**\nWhen you're installing, try and have access to a second computer with a working internet connection. If you run into problems during the install, you can use the other computer to search for a solution.\n\nIf you encounter problems, don't forget to try any \"test installation media\", \"test memory\" and/or \"test hard disk\" options you may be offered on the install disc.\n\nUsing the same wallpaper on your new Linux installation might help make the transition easier psychologically.\n\n---------\n\n**Select a distribution**\nCPU type: When downloading Linux, ensure to select the correct build for your CPU. Many distributions have separate downloads for 32-bit or 64-bit CPU architectures - they also may have downloads for non-X86 CPUs. If you're migrating from Windows, you'll likely want X86, 32-bit or 64-bit.\n\nHave a look at the various Linux distributions available (there's quite a few to choose from) and make a shortlist of possibles. Many of them have a \"Live CD\" which is a version that runs from CD/usb stick which can be downloaded and burned. You boot off the liveCD/usb and you see whether the software works for you & your hardware, without making any changes to your existing Windows install.\n\nSome distributions may pull from stable repositories or testing, more on this below(see Repositories). Some distros may have to reinstall the OS to upgrade to the next version where others may be rolling release. This may affect how you choose to set up home (see \"Chose the location for home\" below).\n\nYou can find a list of distributions in many places, including these:\n\nThe /g/ OS guide (updated to v.1.3.2) http://i.imgur.com/wXsA1Ls.jpg\n\nComparison of Linux distributions http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions\n\nDistroWatch http://www.distrowatch.com/\n\n\nFor recommendations try the articles linked below, or just browse the sidebar. Several distributions have been specifically designed to provide a Windows-like experience, a list of these is below. You could also try the Linux Distribution Chooser (2011).\n\nWhy so many distro?? Don't think of a distro as a different Linux but instead as one linux packaged with a unique collection of software packages. Things like DEs. ONE DE might be Gnome which is similar to a MAC or Amiga in style, while another might be KDE which is similar to windows, or Unity which is like a tablet. They all use GNU and the Linux kernel however and they all pull from the same group of software repositories.\n\n\n- **Windows-like distributions:**\n\n- - Lubuntu http://lubuntu.net/ - install guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/InstallingLubuntu\n\n- - Xubuntu http://xubuntu.org/\n\n- - Kubuntu http://kubuntu.org/\n\n- - Linux Lite https://www.linuxliteos.com/   - install guide https://www.linuxliteos.com/manual/install.html\n\n- - Linux Mint http://www.linuxmint.com/ - Mate edition (the heaviest one in this list) http://www.linuxmint.com/\n\n- - PCLinuxOS http://www.pclinuxos.com/\n\n\n- **Lightweight distributions: (suited to older or low-powered hardware)**\n\n- - Lubuntu - install guide\n\n- - BunsenLabs Linux https://www.bunsenlabs.org/ (The heir to Crunchbang)\n\n- - Bodhi Linux http://www.bodhilinux.com/\n\n- - DistroWatch search - \"Old Computers\" category http://distrowatch.com/search.php?category=Old+Computers\n\n- - list of Lightweight Linux distributions http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Linux_distribution\n\n\n**REALLY DIFFERENT OSs**\n\nLinux comes in a lot of flavours, some are set up to be as tiny as possible and some even to run entirely from RAM.\nPuppy linux is one such Linux OS. Puppy now comes in a variety of flavours and is more suited to machines that windows 95 came on. Precise puppy is the more original flavour http://distro.ibiblio.org/quirky/precise-5.7.1/precise-5.7.1-retro.iso and is a mere 201 MB in size. It uses very tiny prgrams you have never heard of and takes getting used to but it's fully usable if you take the time to learn the programs. It uses seamonkey for instance as seamonkey is a browser, email client, html composer and newsgroups client all in one program(like Netscape used to be). That's part of how it stays so small, and because the entire thing is in RAM is lightning fast. There are heavier version for win 98 and ME machines like Lucid Puppy http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/puppylinux/puppy-5.2.8/lupu-528.005.iso  The puppy website is a horror story http://puppylinux.org/ but you can always go straight to the forums http://murga-linux.com/puppy . \n\n---------\n\n**Download the ISO and Burn it**\n\nIf you don't have the ability to burn a Disto ISO to disc or have really slow internet you can have one sent to you by snailmail, or even pic them up at local computer shops. Otherwise you can download the iso image (some as small as 100MB someover a Gig). You will need to have a CD or DVD burner in you machine and software to run it. You can even put this ISO onto a USB device.  \n\nThere are many guides out there for this.\n\n- http://www.howtogeek.com/191054/how-to-create-bootable-usb-drives-and-sd-cards-for-every-operating-system/\n\n- https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\n\n- http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Install-a-Linux-OS-in-your-USB-Flash-Drive-/\n\n- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tools_to_create_Live_USB_systems\n\n- http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/\n\n- http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/\n\n\n**Verify the hash of the ISO**\n\nThis is to verify the download is intact http://www.howtogeek.com/67241/htg-explains-what-are-md5-sha-1-hashes-and-how-do-i-check-them/\n\n**Do a test boot with a LiveCD**\n\nIt's pretty simple. Insert the distro ISO medium (CD/usb) and use your BIOS UEFI selector to select that medium to boot from. Most distros have tools to test your RAM as well as booting to a version of the distro you can use to poke around and try it out.\n\n---------\n\n**install the new OS**\n\nThis is where things get complicated. There are several things to consider first. Dual boot, location of home. Read the section  below and installing will be covered more later.\n\n\n**Choose Dual Boot or Linux Only**\n\nDual-boot (sometimes called multi-boot) is a good way to experiment. If you want to keep your Windows install, you can do that by using \"dual boot\", where you select which OS you want to use from a menu when you first power on the machine. This topic is a bit complex for this post, so we recommend making a post about it if you have queries (search the linux4noobs sub for \"dual boot\"). There are videos on youtube on how to dual boot.  However, you will need to have sufficient disk space to hold both operating systems at once. Linux is small compared to Windows Each distro page will state it's required space. If you keep an old no longer supported version of windows you should NOT go on the internet with it as it is no longer secure!!! Do not use it for internet, email chat, etcetera, use linux for going online.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DualBoot/Windows\n\nAll of this assumes you are going to allow linux to replace the windows Master Boot Record with Grub2 (linux boot menu), but thre is an alternate method of dual booting keeping the windows menu and using easybcd to put in a linux option. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTgaWs9BD0  This is the diagram in that vid http://i.imgur.com/AFIaGRd.png Keeping the windows loader is a far more complex way to go.\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/139966/how-can-i-add-an-entry-for-ubuntu-to-the-windows-7-boot-menu\n\n\n**Chose the location for home**\n\nFirst what is /home/? Home is where you store your pics, docs, movies etcetera. There are three options for home. Choose /home/ as its own partition or even it's own drive, or inside the Linux install partition. \n\nThe drawback of separating home from the linux install partition is that is a little more complex to set up. \nThe benefit is that the Linux OS partition can be wiped out and your files on home (a separate partition/drive) are safe. Having home on it's own drive means the entire drive the OS is installed on could die and your files are safe on another drive. You just install a new drive, install an os and you are back up and running. See Partitioning further below.  However the drawback of home on it's own drive is that drive can die and you lose your home files. Of course home files should always be backed up to the cloud or another drive so it should be easy to recover in the face of that kind of failure.\n\n\n**Chose your Apps or selecting and installing software**\n\nLinux does not natively support Windows programs, so you'll need to find a \"workalike\" for each Windows application you use. Some distros come with a collection of some of these on the install but they can all be installed later from the repositories or from their websites. More on what a repository is further down below. \n\nHere are some websites that list equivalents.\n\n- http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/Linux-Windows_Software_Equivalents \n\n- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoftwareEquivalents\n\n- http://www.linuxalt.com/\n\n- http://linuxrsp.ru/win-lin-soft/table-eng.html\n\n- http://alternativeto.net/\n\nThe primary APPS people will be concerned about are\n\n- Internet Explorer - Firefox, Chrome, or Seamonkey (not as common as the other two, but it does look more like Internet Explorer)\n\n- MSOffice ->> LibreOffice, KOffice\n\n- Outlook (Express)/Windows Mail ->> Thunderbird (more here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_email_clients)\n\n- Windows Media Player ->> VLC http://www.videolan.org/  (you can get a skin if you'd like http://www.videolan.org/vlc/skins.php?sort=downloads ).\n\n- Paint ->> mtPaint http://mtpaint.sourceforge.net/ is pretty close. There's also GIMP, but it's much more complicated and more powerful.\n\n- Silverlight ->> Pipelight http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html and a user-agent switcher will let you use Silverlight-based websites on Linux.\n\n- Flash ->>  To get the latest Flash, you can either use Chrome, or install Flash player through Pipelight.\n\n- - Note that you should use your package manager to install programs, instead of downloading them from websites.\n\n\n**Windows APPS you can't just do without**\n\nYou can also try Wine https://winehq.org/, which lets some Windows applications run on unix-like systems, including Linux. However this may not work for your particular needs, you'll need to test it to see. There is a compatibility list here https://appdb.winehq.org/. It's also possible to \"virtualize\" your Windows install, using software such as VirtualBox, and run it in a window under Linux. https://www.virtualbox.org/\n\n\n**Running OLD DOS Apps/games**\n\nIf you have DOS apps, try DOSbox http://www.dosbox.com/ or DOSEMU http://www.dosemu.org/ . There are many other emulators that will run on linux from old ARCADE MAME games to Sony playstation.\n\n\n**Repositories**\n\nAbove we mention repositories. What are they? Well with windows you can search for software on the web and download a file and extract and install it. It Linux all the software is in one place called a repository. There are many repos.  Major repositories are designed to be malware free. Some with stable old stogy software that won't crash your system. Some are testing and might breakthings, and others are bleeding edge aka \"unstable\" and likely to break things.  By break things we mean things like dependancies. One version of software might need another small piece of software to work say  program called Wallpaper uses a small program called SillyScreenColours(SCC) V1, but SSC might be up to V3 already but V3 won't work for Wallpaper because it needs V1. Well in a testing repo another new program say ExtremeWallpaper might need V3 of SCC and if you install it, it will remove V1 to install V3 and now the other program Wallpaper doesn't work. That's the kind of thing we mean by break. So to keep that kind of thing from happening Linux pulls from repositories that are labelled/staged for stability. So when you want more software you open your distro's \"software manager\". An application that connects to the repository where you select and install software from there and it warns you of any possible problems.  You can still get software from websites with Linux but installing may involve copy and pasting commands to do it or to \"compile from source\" to make sure all the program dependencies are met. You can sometime break things doing it that way however, or what you are trying to install won't run on your distros kernel or unique collection of software.\n\n\n**Software manager.**\n\nEach distro has chosen a repository and can have different software programs to install from them.\nDebian systems use APT where others like Fedora use RPM, or YUM on Redhat, or Pacman on Arch.  These are a collection of text based commands that can be run from terminal. Most desktop distros have GUI sofware managers like Synaptic or their own custom GUI software. Mint's is called Mintinstall. Each distro has their own names for their repositories.  Ubuntu has 4 repositories Main, Universe, restricted, and Multiverse as well as PPA's.  Personal Package Archives.Packages in PPAs do not undergo the same process of validation as packages in the main repositories\n\n- Main - Canonical-supported free and open-source software. (??stable, testing, unstable??)\n\n- Universe - Community-maintained free and open-source software. (??stable, testing, unstable??)\n\n- Restricted - Proprietary drivers for devices.\n\n- Multiverse - Software restricted by copyright or legal issues.\n\nYou can change your system to go from Debian stable to only use testing or you can even run a mixed system pulling from stable and testing but this is more complex. Each distro will have a way to add repositories (or PPA's if ubuntu based) or change sources.\nOn Debian based Mint to install software you would launch the software manager>>input your password>> then either do a word search like desktop publishing, or drawing and see the matches or you can navigate categories like Games, Office, Internet.  For instance Graphics then breaks down to 3D, Drawing, Photography, Publishing, Scanning, and viewers. When you find software you want to install you click on it to read it's details. For instance Scribus, a desktop page layout program, and you get more details *\"Scribus is an open source desktop page layout program with the aim of producing commercial grade output in PDF and Postscript. Scribus supports professional DTP features, such as CMYK color\"* and here you can simply click a button \"Install\" to install software. It's the same process to remove software. There is a toggle in menu \"view\" for \"installed\" and \"Available\". The same software can be installed or removed via synaptec but it's a little less graphical and more texted based but still GUI based point and click. It's a similar process in other distributions.\n\n\n---------\n---------\n\n**Actually installing**\n\nThere are Two more hurdles to running linux. \n\nUEFI & Secure boot: newer machines have a feature which can prevent non-Windows operating systems from booting. You may need to disable Secure Boot in your BIOS / UEFI if your hardware has this feature. http://www.howtogeek.com/175649/what-you-need-to-know-about-using-uefi-instead-of-the-bios/\n\nDrivers: This can get tricky, especially for newer, consumer-grade hardware. If you find a problem here, please make a post about it so we can assist. Using a live CD can show up problems here before you spend time on a full install. Some hardware is so new or rare there just aren't open drivers available for it and you may have to use a non open proprietary driver or change some hardware. This is mostly going to affect wifi cards and graphics cards. A lot of older hardware that won't run on win7 and up will run fine on Linux because the drivers are available and supported. There is a graphical program for adding and removing drivers, but it's best to look up the text commands when changing a graphics card driver because you may lose graphics and be reduced to a command line to enter text on to revert the change to get your graphics back if the driver you tried failed.\n\n\n**Partitioning**\n\nThis is where things can get SCARY. Not really, but it can be challenging for some. What is a partition? It is simply a division of your hard drive. Think of Stark in Farscape \"Your side my side, your side my side\". Basically you are labeling a chunk of a hard drive space to be used for a specific purpose. A section to hold boot info, a section to use for swapping memory to hard drive, a section for windows, a section for Linux, a section for holding docs pics etcetera called HOME in linux. Home is where your user account folder will be created. You can do this partitioning in windows with it's own partitioning tool if you prefer. This is best for shrinking the windows partition because windows can have a RAID set up of can be spanning multiple hard drives and sometime windows needs to be shut down holding the shift key to make it completely release a lock on the hard drive. Or you can use a tool on the live distro called Gparted to do this. Gparted takes a little getting used to visually but does the same thing the windows tool does. The one thing it can't do is force windows to let go of the hard drive and keep the partition intact, it can forcibly wipe the partition however. You can use gparted to label partitions as \"/home\" where your docs go(home if not specifically designated is inside the Linux OS space), or \"/\" the linux OS, or \"boot\" where grub2 will go, or \"swap\", and there are multiple file system types available fat32, ntfs ext2,3,4 and more. There are dozens of videos on youtube on how to use.  \n\nWhy use Gparted? Doesn't the installer re-partition?  Yes it does but it may not have the options you want, there is a manual option that is gparted but sometimes it is a different GUI of gparted with fewer options or some other partition software altogether. The manual options vary from distro to distro. Some will let you share space with windows by using a slider but it gives you no options to make home a separate partition or put it on a separate drive. Others only have \"take over whole disc\" or \"manual\". It varies distro to distro.  If there is a hard drive in the machine you absolutely don't want touched you should shut down and unplug the power from it. If a partition has menu items grayed out it means it is mounted and must be unmounted before operations can be performed on it. Often SWAP will have to be unmounted. The labeling of hard drives in windows is IDE0, IDE1 or HD0,1 ; HD0,2 ; HD1 etc.. In linux the nomenclature is SDA, SDB and partitions are numbered SDA1, SDA2, SDB1,SDB2,SDB3, SDC1, SDD1 etc..  So after you have decided on how to partition then decide if to use the windows tool or the liveCD automatic tool or the manual tool(or gparted).  Yes as the install is running you can use the livecd software to browse the internet.\n\nAlso be aware of FAKE RAID.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto\n\n- Gparted Faq http://gparted.org/faq.php\n\n- Why a boot partition is important if using LARGE drives https://carteryagemann.com/boot-partition.html\n\n- Fixing Grub http://gparted.org/display-doc.php?name=help-manual&lang=C#gparted-restore-grub-2\n\n---------\n\n**Printers**\n\nUsing a printer on a home network attached to and shared from a windows machine for a linux machine is fairly straight forward, but if your entire network is now all linux machines you need to know to do so(share the printer) by opening a web browser on and typing 127.0.0.1:631 . Then clicking on the printers tab. On most linux distros this is already all set up but if it isn't https://www.blackmoreops.com/2013/11/15/install-configure-printers-linux-cups-foomatic-db/  or look at https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/cups.html\n\n---------\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n\nThis is a huge topic and really needs to be narrowed down to what you are troubleshooting.\n\n- General https://www.google.ca/search?q=how+to+troubleshoot+linux&oq=how+to+troubleshoot+linux&aqs=chrome..69i57.6172j0j1&client=ubuntu&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\n\n- Wifi https://www.google.ca/search?q=how+to+troubleshoot+linux&oq=how+to+troubleshoot+linux&aqs=chrome..69i57.6172j0j1&client=ubuntu&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=how+to+troubleshoot+linux+wifi\n\n- Graphics card https://www.google.ca/search?q=how+to+troubleshoot+linux&oq=how+to+troubleshoot+linux&aqs=chrome..69i57.6172j0j1&client=ubuntu&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=how+to+troubleshoot+linux+graphics+card\n\n- Sound https://www.google.ca/search?q=how+to+troubleshoot+linux&oq=how+to+troubleshoot+linux&aqs=chrome..69i57.6172j0j1&client=ubuntu&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=how+to+troubleshoot+linux+sound\n\n- Cameras\n\n- smartphones\n\n- itunes\n\n- printers\n\n---------\n\n**Recommended reading:**\n\n- I'm thinking of making a complete switch to Linux, thoughts? http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/1xu4u3/im_thinking_of_making_a_complete_switch_to_linux/\n\n- As a beginner, which build of Linux should I first install to learn the basics? http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/21b76u/as_a_beginner_which_build_of_linux_should_i_first/\n\n- L4NG: The basics of Linux http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/225f4r/l4ng_the_basics_of_linux/\n\n- What are your must haves for your Linux machine? http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/1w80uc/what_are_your_must_haves_for_your_linux_machine/\n\n- Need help picking a distro?

If you're not a noob, you will probably cringe a lot.\n\n  \nMy past attempts, years ago, with Linux always ended up in failure. When the Steam Deck was released I decided to try it out, loved it. When M$ decided to end support to Windows 10 soon and loaded Win 11 with even more spyware and ads, I decided to try Linux on desktop.\n\n  \nStarting with the Steam Deck (Arch based), it's a pretty much console experience, with some pc capabilities. For the most part you use it as intended and let Valve make sure you have all the latest goodies in a safe environment. It wouldn't make a great system for a desktop computer but it could work well as a custom gaming console.\n\n  \nI tried Manjaro (Arch) on my pc. I thought that since it was also Arch based like the deck, it would be similar. In many ways it is, but without daddy Gabe's hand to guide you, it is very easy to break stuff. It has all the newest bells and whistles but compatibility with software can be an issue (most applications can't catch up with Arch so they don't support it). I broke the system within a couple of days, trying to do stuff it wasn't meant to.\n\n  \nThen I went for Ubuntu (Debian). As the most popular distro among noobs, it has the widest compatibility with apps. However, they seem to be turning into the Apple of Linux. I also hated the Gnome environment. Trying to instal KDE broke the system. Bye Bye!\n\n\n\nThen I went for Mint Cinnamon (Debian) a second time (the first time went badly but it was a very long time ago). \n\n\\+I loved the Cinnamon environment which is pretty much the same to me as KDE. \n\n\\+Their desklets allowed me to configure my secondary mini screen into a system monitor adequately, not quite how I was envisioning it but beautiful nontheless. It was certainly prettier than the things you see in r/Conkyporn with less resource drain (seriously, Conky may be powerful at making system monitoring widgets but it takes too many resources to be of any use). \n\n\\+I was able to install Chrome and NordVPN very easily because it is based on Ubuntu, without all their annoying stuff, so compatibility is brilliant. -\n\n\\+Setting up the timeshift utility to take daily snapshots to a different drive (it's like system restore for windows, only much much better) allowed me to experiment and try many stuff, a lot of which ended up in failure but I could just restore everything and try again, meaning that I learned a lot and had fun in the process. \n\n\\+I love Mint and recommend it to everyone. But it's not without it's flaws.\n\n\\-Debian distros focus on reliability rather than experimentation and freshness. As a result, most stuff are fairly outdated. It is still using a very old kernel (the heart of linux, the thing that connects all Linux distros) and fairly old GPU drivers. As a gamer, I'm used to always ensure to have the latest drivers with every new game.\n\n\\-I also couldn't figure out how to play Alan Wake 2 on it, so I ended up installing Windows on a partition on a different SSD just for this game.\n\n  \nI decided to install Bazzite (Fedora Atomic) on a different ssd than Mint (the same as Windows), to see what all the fuss is about. They claim it is inspired by the Steam Deck OS, while being a very capable desktop OS. At first, I wasn't impressed by the setup process. \n\n\\-I had to manually make the partitions so that it wouldn't wipe my windows installation. \n\n\\-I also discovered that Atomic means that the system is semi locked down, you are less free to make changes to the system and install things as easily. Trying to setup NordVPN on it made me realise that everything I had learned in Mint wouldn't help much here. The only thing that did carry over is that I shouldn't try to brute force stuff and things would work out like it usually does in Windows so I took it slow. \n\n\\+I was able to instal snap as a download source using the 'sudo dnf install snapd' command and then find Nord in the Discover software center. Getting there was harder than it sounds because every discussion I could find on the topic would steer me into wildly different directions. But now that works!\n\n\\+I found it has a much greater pool of widgets than the desklets that Mint has, allowing for a much more powerful monitoring screen, although positioning them properly can be a bit of a chore but it's worth it.\n\n\\+Buzzite is using a very fresh stable Kernel and the latest GPU drivers as far as I can see, which resulted in a significant improvement in framerates in gaming, very visible results, about 20 more frames per second! I was even able to get Alan Wake 2 running, with framerates that were also about 20 more fps than Windows! I'm very impressed!\n\nBuzzite is quickly becoming my new favourite distro. It has unlocked more power from my PC, even though it seems a bit more inflexible, which also means it's harder to break, and I haven't found a backup utility like timeshift in case that it does break. I will be making it my daily driver for now, but Mint is staying in my back pocket SSD. \n\n  \nFeel free to ask any questions you may have and I may be able to help, or to roast my inexperience and mistakes.", "output": "As a seasoned Linux user and someone working on the technical side (masters degree in CS), excellent advice.\n\nI think the best takeaway is the \"don't brutforce things\" like in Windows, as much like in real life, that leads to things poorly fitting or damage to stuff.\n\nAnd about Ubuntu and KDE Plasma, just for that reason the Ubuntu Flavours exist. They are Ubuntu with different software preinstalled, but all of them coming from the Ubuntu repositories. Kubuntu is what you wanted in the first place."}
{"id": "1i58ry2", "instruction": "Why Linux over Windows?", "input": "Last week, I tried Linux (Pop!\\_OS) for the first time. I enjoyed experimenting and learning how things work in Linux, but I found myself missing the ease-of-use of Windows. I understand the common reasons people choose Linux over Windows, such as better security, performance, and control. However, I’m looking for practical, real-world use cases where Linux is truly superior to Windows.\n\nI use my computer daily for university work, general browsing, YouTube, gaming, and programming. Are there specific scenarios in these areas where Linux is objectively better than Windows? For example, when it comes to programming, are there tools or workflows in Linux that provide significant advantages?\n\nI’m not necessarily looking for answers like “Linux is more secure” or “It runs smoothly on older hardware.” Instead, I want concrete examples where Linux genuinely shines in day-to-day use, gaming, or programming. While I understand there are very specific cases where Linux excels, I’m more interested in broader scenarios that might justify making Linux my primary operating system, rather than something I use only occasionally.\n\nTL;DR: What are the practical reasons to choose Linux over Windows for everyday tasks, gaming, and programming?", "output": "If you don't see a difference then stay with windows. But I personally find Linux faster and easier to use.\n\n\nLinux also gets in my way less, I had to boot up a windows vm for some work and it tried to sell me at least 2 things before I saw the desktop. To me that is in acceptable for MY computer.\n\n\nIt is also heavy on resources (ram, storage, etc) but with most people computes this will not matter much."}

There are tons and tons of IDEs to choose from, on Linux. The one catch for you could be MS Office: there is no official Microsoft version for Linux. There is LibreOffice (used to be OpenOffice), which has all (or at least most) of the same functionality. The UI is closer to MS Office 2007-ish,than it is to modern MS Office, so it may take a couple days to adjust where you expect to find things, but it's all basically there, and LibreOffice supports a lot of different file formats, including MS Office.\n\nThe problem comes when you try and open your LibreOffice document in MS Office. I find that when I write equations, or format tables in LibreOffice, when I open it in Word (even using the correct file format), the equations usually disappear and the formatting in tables can sometimes go funky. If MS Office is mission-critical (such as because you are often working on something with more than just you and they definitely will not switch), that could be a real problem. On the other hand, you coil try dual-booting, but I've never done it with a Mac, since I migrated from Windows.\n\nYou could learn LaTeX, as well, but that's like trying to solve a problem with a screw not going into a hole by getting a multitool.

{"id": "8byyyo", "instruction": "Could someone ELI5 regular expressions?", "input": "EDIT: Loads of good answers. Thank you everybody. Now everything it's clear. I think I'll just need to make some practice now. Thank you a lot. :D", "output": "**What is a regular expression?**  It's a concise way to describe a finite state automata.\n\n**What does that mean *in English*?**  It's a matching machine.  But instead of saying \"is it john\" (`variable == 'john'`) you're saying \"does it look like john, John, Jon, Johnn, jon\" (`variable matches [Jj]oh?n+`), you can use \"if\"s to do this instead, but for a word like Johnny where you wanted to let just upper and lowercase on some letters, you can get to 10 or 20 'if' statements really fast.  (there are programs to automatically generate these if statements from regular expressions called \"parser generators\" or \"lexers\")\n\n**Are they the same in every language?** No.  Syntax varies between languages and tools, especially \"metacharacters\" which are shortcuts that go backslash letter (example: `\\b`) and different tools have different support.\n\n**What's with the weird slashes? (in some languages)**  They're the same as quotes around strings in languages that use them. (`sed` lets you choose in the substitute command, slashes are generally *the worst* possible choice since you're usually replacing paths and that leads to a lot of escaping; most tutorials tell you to use slashes.  I recommend #)\n\n**What can you usually count on?**\n\n1. Literal letters.  If you put a j you want to know if it's a j\n2. Classes. Generally anything in these brackets [abc] will match a or b or c.  \n3. Just a dot usually means any letter. (what is a letter though may vary especially if you speak a multibyte language like Korean)\n3. Options (x|y) x or y shines in ((James)|(John))\n4. Quantifiers: how many: exactly 1 (nothing), one or more (+), or 0 or more (*), 0 or 1 (?)\n\nSo, if I want to match John OR Jon, I can say: \n\n\\^[Jj]oh?n$\n\nThis means you want something that:\n\n\\^ means start of line  \n[Jj] means starts with J or j,  \no means literally the letter o,  \nh means literally the letter h, but ? means either 1 or 0 of them.  that is to say \"h is optional\"  \nn means literally the letter n  \n$ means the end of the line\n\nSo, ^ and $ are new, and they prevent matching a line of \"Joneses\" because we maybe don't want that in our application.  Maybe we have a file with one name per line of people in the school and we wanted to know how many johns there were and we're going to pipe it into `wc -l` for that.\n\nSo, then you found out there's a few Johnns at the school and maybe one 'Johnnn'; someone even mentioned a 'Johnnnn'.  So, you want to match any string with however many 'n's on the end, but at least one, so now you do [Jj]oh?n+.  The + means 1 n, but also any more 'n's.\n\nSo, all there's some characters there that are part of regular expressions, what if I want to match \"+\" or \"?\" well, then  you have to escape them with backslash.  So, let's say you wanted to know if someone entered an addition problem?  You can say [1234567890], but there's a shorthand for that in most languages like `\\d`, so, all you have to do is check if it matches `\\d+\\d` for one digit, but wait! that actually just means digits, so this is where they start looking stupid: `\\d+\\\\+\\d+'  which is:\n\n\\d means any digit and the + means 1 or more.   \n\\\\+ means the literal \"+\"  \n\\d again means any digit and the + means 1 or more."}

{"id": "d9z8nv", "instruction": "How Linux came to me in a world where PC's was dominated by other operating systems", "input": "After reading Linux and more generally alternatives operating systems stories on Reddit. I decided to share my experience, my story about computing. I'm very lucky that my vision was confirmed in a successful job in the IT services of a company essentially using free software in each steps of the production for more than 30 years.\n\nMa father was analyst programmer and had a company writing software for clothes shops in the 80's, that's how he met my mother. I'm born in 94 and I remember sitting on my father's lap while he was programming on **DOS**. He's gone in 1998 but I was still powering up his old Toshiba laptop to launch the automated demo he wrote, the command was simply \"CD\" enter... Probably meaning \"Customer Demo\". I've also inherited his books on BASIC, DBASE and C programming in which I took years to dive into...\n\nAfter that, my mother got a job just near our apartment in a small company writing software for medical practice, she was doing installations and technical support of the product. I was in elementary school at this time ( between 6 and 11  ) and had a great teacher very involved in computing at the time. He managed to get about 50 old PC's from a factory. They were running a mix of Windows 95 and 98 and spent hours with us in the computing room carefully explaining how they're working. We've learnt Von Neumann architecture, binary representation and many concepts, he was also giving us games copies on 3\"1/4 floppy disks. The point that, there one PC was different... Every PC were booting with the Windows splash screen except one. There were strange lines beginning with green \"\\[OK\\]\" and messages I was not understanding ending with a gray page guarded by a welcoming penguin.\n\n>\\- Master ? Why is this PC different ?\n\n*In France, teachers were called \"Masters\" by children before a law changed it. Here Tux is also called a \"Manchot\" which is not the same animal than a \"Pingouin\".*\n\n>\\- It's because this computer is our server, he's responsible of networking and sharing files. All the others computers rely on it. Instead of Windows, what you see there is called **Mandrake**, a Linux operating system.\n\nI was 6 or 7 years old and I promised myself that I'll understand those strange lines at boot and make servers with this friendly mascot too when I grow up. I was also liking this name, \"Linux\".\n\nI live in a small city always being very independent in its history. The library and the municipal administration were quickly adopting Linux by not wanting to pay Windows licenses and made it to the disposition of the youth department. There were a huge computing shop selling **Mandriva** ( what comes after Mandrake ) copies for about 2€ per disk... And the presence of the \"Editions Diamond\", still a major edition about Linux and free software magazines in Europe constituted a great opportunity for me to learn computing and follow my father.\n\nI've successfully installed myself my first GNU/Linux distribution on my own computer when I was 12, it was Mandriva 2006. Before that I was very happy with Windows XP, but my vision changed from this point. Someone in my family were having a company writing software ( yes again... ) and affiliates making websites allowed me to discover this world because I seemed very interested. Everyone here were running Mandriva and KDE 3 on PC's bought without OSes. There were kind persons in this company who took time to learn me about **UNIX, shell and vim basics**. UNIX is a concept carefully designed by its creators, and there's many many implementations of it, Linux and GNU is just one of the possible combinations.\n\n*If you were wondering, I still use vim today, I did not managed how to quit.*\n\nI think dual booting never interested me. I just wanted to learn programming, handling and discovering programs and their design. I've spend years testing every major distributions and many other free UNIX-like systems available on PC. I literally have piles of burnt CD-ROM with each releases and was pretty excited to read news about that. After Mandriva, I've been using **Ubuntu**, from 8.04 to 12.04. And I just want to say that was incredibly great.\n\nIn the same period. I was beginning to learn **Gentoo** and even printed the handbook to read it in my bed... I quickly understood the principle and the interest behind building each software for your own CPU model and only enabled what hardware support you need and what feature inside programs you want. The main problem is that It was slow to build on Athlon 64... So I've began to use mainly **Archlinux** and it was absolutely great for the a anti-bloat mood I had and to chase everything I was considering eating my resources. Archlinux was I think the greatest Linux I had for that because you begin with a generic light system and have easy access to bunches of alternative software you often had to compile manually on other distros back then. I had the impression I could install anything I could ever need in just one command...\n\nI've installed many... many Ubuntu, **Linux Mint** and **Debian** to people asking me and believe me or not... They still use them and are shocked by how simple it is and how stable it is compared to Windows. LTS/Stable installations keep running for ages. Even if it's vital to update for security. It does what you says, deserves only the user and don't force you to do anything or interrupts you when you don't want. Even more, if something is not like you want it to be, you have the power and the freedom to change it. On any aspect. *Of course this require knowledge on how to proceed. But I don't know any community or other user not being helpful if they have time and you respect them.*\n\nThere's been 5 Years I'm running Debian on the unstable branch on my PC, because if something goes wrong after an upgrade, I know how to report it and possibly fix it. I have to admit: I still being very lucky. But I definitely recommend stable releases of any major distribution for new users, until they understand what exactly is a distribution, what are releases cycles and, what is stability.\n\nFor my part, I never had any issue with missing support for hardware but sometimes, proprietary chips are not helpful and you can install required drivers and firmware from non-free repositories. Debian community also build an installation image including proprietary firmware if needed. But it's true to say the there was lot of incompatible hardware due to the large quantity of different PC assemblers with different chips. ***That's why I strongly-recommend looking the internet for eventual issues before buying.***\n\nAs said at the beginning, I've joined the IT team of a company editing and maintaining specialized software for UNIX, Windows, OS X and mobile phones. And its a great pleasure to work on Debian as my two coworkers ( one about 15 years, the other even more... ). Many of the developers are using Linux Mint, because the release cycle is more adapted on their needs. We have one coworker that uses **CentOS** on his workstation. We're having a server room and we're migrating Debian servers to CentOS with **EPEL** repositories because they're a little bit easier to auto-install for us and are maintained a bit longer.\n\nToday, It's important to consider the design of UNIX and despite being ancient, still an elegant suit to the Von Neumann computer model and inter-machine communications we've built on it. It's important to consider standards like the Single Unix Specification and look at the Commercial UNIX history and wars, University UNIX implementations and the Free Software movement which all that came far before Windows or Mac OS X that most people only know.\n\nMore a program is large, less it tend to the perfection. No software is perfect in term of functionality or support to anyone, whatever they're free (as in freedom) or not. I think free and open source licenses are essential to a better world where computing tend to be omnipresent, as well that the freedom for anyone is to be able to choose responsibly. I have many examples, situations and analogies to that, but it's not my initial subject.\n\nOn a free operating system, the user is responsible of his own computing and it has consequences. It require deeper knowledge on how computer works physically and how operating systems share its resources and secures the data logically.  Only that gives more chances to be right and comfortable with it.\n\nI had so much to say. I still have so much to share about it. Maybe I'll start a blog...\n\nPS: I'm not used to write long English texts and will appreciate any advice to be more readable and of course, pointing me if there's mistakes.  And don't hesitates to ask me if you have some questions about the story, how I do certain things or what I would recommend to new users.\n\nSee you o/", "output": "Hehe, I'm not sure about the point but it was an enjoyable story to read.\n\nAnd props for the English from a Frenchman, might be the best I've seen!"}

But, again, 2024, incredible that i cant just double click a thing and get the drivers installed and move along on my day. I want an OS, not another hobby. Also, im dual booting from Windows, and the other 2 disks i have were nowhere to be seen, had to mount them and what not. Other than that everything seemed fine minus some hiccups here and there installing dev tools and building Unreal from source and lots of confusion about who the hell is Wayland and who hurt him and why X11 is his darkest nemesis. \n\n  \nThen, thanks to a coworker, i decide to try Ubuntu, which i used before in the Unity days and stopped using exactly because of the Unity days. The installer live image had already recognized my wifi card... Install was done, update done and lo and behold, nvidia drivers installed. Download steam and would you look at that, Proton is already working. Flawless. Exactly what i want from an OS. The windows disc? already mounted and ready to open my files from there. Chef kiss. 17 minutes and i went from the setup tool to up and running pulling my stuff from github into Rider with Darkest Dungeon running in another workspace. \n\n  \nSo, please im obviously too new into Linux to know whats going on, but why on earth would anyone recommend Fedora instead of Ubuntu if THAT is the out of the box experience?

All you need in a programming language is the ability to open a file, and that's almost certainly a given in nearly all of them.\n\nThat means that *you do not need any library to be able to access many of your system's subsystems*. Hardware temperature sensors? Process information? Battery status? Just `fopen()` the corresponding endpoint file and read the information, done.\n\nIn some cases you can even use this to directly access hardware registers. For example, you can expose the I2C bus(es) of your system as filesystem endpoints, or perhaps the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi, and read from/write to them using nothing but bash. (A very common use case for this is controlling your system's fans, for example.)\n\nAnother aspect is piping: You can pretty much pipe any file into any other file, which makes it easy to accomplish many tasks that would need a specialized tool or GUI e.g. on Windows. Want to create a backup image of a disk? `cat /dev/sdx > /tmp/backup.img`. Want to discard the output of some command? `command > /dev/null`. Want to leverage the system's random generator, e.g. to create a file filled with random data? `dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/random.bin bs=2k count=1`."}

I never had problems or bugs in gnome the only annoying thing is packagekit but I just remove it and lock it. I also like it because you don't have any dock/panel taking out screen space, so I can run my programs practically full screen (only having the black top bar but that is actually very slim). I can switch workspaces with keyboard and that's cool :)\n\nPeople say that GNOME is heavy but it actually runs on 800/900 MB at idle and, yes KDE runs on something like 700 MB but are 100/200 MB actually relevant on a modern system that usually has from 8 to 16 GB of RAM?\n\nThanks in advance for the attention ;)", "output": "Gnome was designed around the idea of mobile and desktop integration... one interface to rule them all.  The market has proven this to be a flawed approach... sacrificing desktop usability and performance for handheld support which no one uses.  Also GNOME3 has been dumbed down... if you design a user interface for everyone it does not work well for anyone... especially for technical and pro users.  GNOME seems to always be doubling down on these two unhelpful directions.\n\nBecause of this GNOME2 was wonderful and featureful, then it was dumped for GNOME3 by the developers... and it fragmented the community and users.  Now when you say GNOME what to you even mean?  MATE (a GNOME2 fork), GNOME (GNOME3), Unity (which is now dead), or Cinnamon (an attempt to make GNOME3 look like GNOME2). It also lead to a lot of software incompatibilities too which we are stuck with... i.e. between GNOME2 and 3, and all of the following systems MATE, GNOME, Cinnamon, XFCE, etc.  It is a real mess now.\n\nThere is also the question of how much graphics acceleration that one needs.  If your using GNOME on laptop fine, but if you want to run it remotely via VNC or with a VM when you don't have hardware acceleration, software rendering is very slow and unappealing.  Use to be there were a lot of options in GNOME2 and the window manager that allowed it to work without acceleration... but now... these have all been removed and your forced to use XFCE for example for these shorts of use cases or put up with a very slow GNOME3.\n\nThere is also the application developer side... where GTK2 was somewhat cross platform... GTK3... I don't thing anyone would recommend that for cross platform support.  As a result we are kind of stuck with QT for that... and that is not native in terms of GNOME.  Again a real mess.\n\nSo there is no one answer.  Do I use GNOME, yes... but only in cases where I have hardware acceleration like on my laptop for example.  Elsewhere I use XFCE.

Who never got over the \"ooog, fire bad!\" response to change? It's like that, but on a digital level. \n\nSystemd literally made all of my computers boot twice as fast. And of the 40-50 computers I've upgrade to it, not a single had any systemd related bugs. Which is unheard of, when replacing major components. Last time Ubuntu switched init systems (long before systemd), it resulted in one of the worst bugs Ubuntu has ever dealt with. A standard system update broke the x server for many users (it may not have been xserver that broke, but it did result in computers not booting to the desktop, and it's been long enough I don't remember all the details, full disclosure).  \n\nIt's a fantastic approach that has quickly become THE STANDARD on every major Linux distribution. And many average users still have the idea that everyone smarter than them that makes this wonderful technology we all depend on, must be idiots, because they read a whiny Reddit post from someone who couldn't code their way out of a wet paper bag. \n\nBasically, people are the worst. You can improve their lives, and 10 percent of them won't stop complaining the entire time. \n\nIf you didn't see the arch init maintainers post (someone who understands init systems better than everyone in this thread, myself included) I'm going to copy paste it here:\n\n\n----\nSystemd From an Arch init maintainer perspective:\n\nI was the primary maintainer for Arch's init scripts for a while and I can share a couple of thoughts.\n\nArch's initscripts were incredibly stupid. In their first phase, there was a static set of steps that would be performed on every boot. There was almost no way to adjust the behaviour here. In their second phase, the configured daemons were started in order, which only meant that a init scripts were called one after another.\n\nIn the early 2000s, that seemed like a good idea and has worked for a while. But with more complex setups, the shortcomings of that system become apparent.\n\n* With hardware becoming more dynamic and asynchronous initialization of drivers in the kernel, it was impossible to say when a certain piece of hardware would be available. For a long time, this was solved by first triggering uevents, then waiting for udev to \"settle\". This often took a very long time and still gave no guarantee that all required hardware was available. Working around this in shell code would be very complex, slow and error-prone: You'd have to retry all kinds of operations in a loop until they succeed. Solution: An system that can perform actions based on events - this is one of the major features of systemd.\n\n* Initscripts had no dependency handling for daemons. In times where only a few services depended on dbus and nothing else, that was easy to handle. Nowadays, we have daemons with far more complex dependencies, which would make configuration in the old initscripts-style way hard for every user. Handling dependencies is a complex topic and you don't want to deal with it in shell code. Systemd has it built-in (and with socket-activation, a much better mechanism to deal with dependencies).\n\n* Complex tasks in shell scripts require launching external helper program A LOT. This makes things very slow. Systemd handles most of those tasks with builtin fast C code, or via the right libraries. It won't call many external programs to perform its tasks.\n\n* The whole startup process was serialized. Also very slow. Systemd can parallelize it and does so quite well.\n\n* No indication of whether a certain daemon was already started. Each init script had to implement some sort of PID file handling or similar. Most init scripts didn't. Systemd has a 100% reliable solution for this based on Linux cgroups.\n\n* Race conditions between daemons started via udev rules, dbus activation and manual configuration. It could happen that a daemon was started multiple times (maybe even simultaneously), which lead to unexpected results (this was a real problem with bluez). Systemd provides a single instance where all daemons are handled. Udev or dbus don't start daemons anymore, they tell systemd that they need a specific daemon and systemd takes care of it.\n\n* Lack of confiurability. It was impossible to change the behaviour of initscripts in a way that would survive system updates. Systemd provides good mechanisms with machine-specific overrides, drop-ins and unit masking.\n\n* Burden of maintenance: In addition to the aforementioned design problems, initscripts also had a large number of bugs. Fixing those bugs was always complicated and took time, which we often did not have. Delegating this task to a larger community (in this case, the systemd community) made things much easier for us.\n\nI realize that many of these problems could be solved with some work, and some were already solved by other SysV-based init systems. There was no system that solved all of these problems and did so in a realiable manner, as systemd does.\n\nSo, for me personally, when systemd came along, it solved all the problems I ever had with system initialization. What most systemd critics consider \"bloat\", I consider necessary complexity to solve a complex problem generically. You can say what you want about Poettering, but he actually realized what the problems with system initialization were and provided a working solution.\n\nI could go on for hours, but this should be a good summary.\n\n2brainz\n\nI was the primary maintainer for Arch's init scri...\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/4lzxs3/why_did_archlinux_embrace_systemd/d3rhxlc?utm_source=reddit-android"}

It is the 1tb (!) of cloud storage that I get for free.\n\nFor the longest time I've used the free dropbox plan to store my documents in the cloud so I could access them anywhere, but now I can store almost anything with the 1tb in OneDrive. Documents, music collection, photos, everything is there and synced to my desktop, laptop and phone.\n\nAt the same time, my frustrations with windows have been increasing over the years but I've stuck with it because there has always been something that I could not get working on linux. Now with win11 on the horizon I once more feel compelled to se if I can ditch windows in favour of linux. A lot has happened over the years to make linux more appealing and approachable to normies and noobs like myself, so the main thing that is keeping me on windows this time is the lack of oneDrive functionality.\n\nMy question is this: is there a way to get oneDrive working in linux the way it does in windows, a folder that appears in the file manager, that syncs my files to the cloud? I've found out about Insync which seems promising but I find very little info on how it actually works and how it is to use. I could also go back to dropbox however I'd rather avoid paying for yet an other subscription if I can.\n\nEdit: thank you so much everyone for all of your suggestions! I felt quite lost this morning but now I have a much better understanding of what my options are!

(For those that don’t know, Zhorn Stickies is a closed-source but great app for my needs.) It can run via Wine.\n* Speaking of Wine, a lot of people seem to have issues with it.\n* How do Wine and PlayOnLinux differ from each other?\n* Sync.com’s app can’t seem to run on Linux. Worst case, I’ll just look for an alternative.\n* Aren’t there privacy issues if I run Linux in a VM on Windows 10? (My main reason for wanting to just nuke it.)\n* Drains the battery faster?

But mostly it’s just Stockholm Syndrome, my attachment to Microsoft, I guess.)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHello,\n\nI hope my post is okay here.\n\nMy questions below (TL;DR)...but I hope you’ll also read my long “backstory.” (Sorry, these might be a no-brainer but I’m in a panic-ish mode thanks and screw you, Windows 10.)\n\n1. What is the best distro for me? (As a noob, I can not conceive of the idea of “distro-hopping” yet. Forever Windows user here.)\n2. Do you think I can learn the least “required” Linux knowledge in, like, 2 to 4 weeks?\n3. Is it okay to just wipe out Windows and install Linux right away, especially on the brand new laptop? (Haven’t tried the wiping out yet, though. Not so techie!)\n4. What one Linux resource/website can you recommend that can give me the “progressive education” and that I can stick with (for the least overwhelm experience)?\n5. Any tips for the noob?\n6. (Privacy-speak) I don’t live in any of the Five/Nine/Fourteen Eyes countries. I actually think it’s nuts for me to move to Linux. But...should I take the leap anyway? Or is Windows 10 not that big of a deal for the average person—with average PC needs—like me?\n\n\\---\n\nThe backstory:\n\nI’ve been a Windows user all my life, but not-really-techie because I haven’t tried building a PC or un/installing OS’es yet.\n\nToday I just got a brand new laptop. It’s meant to be a backup unit for my main workstation/desktop PC.\n\nThe new laptop has pre-installed Windows 10. Because it’s a privacy nightmare, I asked the guys at the store whether they could downgrade it to 8.1, but they couldn’t because its hardware isn’t compatible with 8.1 anymore.\n\nThe other day I thought I might “like” using Linux primarily because of the privacy/security/freedom it offers. It was also just then I started reading about Linux.\n\nHowever, after browsing r/privacy and r/privacytoolsIO, I realized I DO want to stay away from the shit that is Windows 10...or any Windows for that matter. Kinda growing sick of the drama. I want to have the peace of mind in that the things that run in my units are the only ones I need (and hopefully understand).\n\nHonestly, it’s like I don’t want to deal with Windows anymore, ever.\n\nIf it helps, I enjoy simplicity. I don’t need the best UX. I pretty much need things to just work.\n\nI even looked for ways to make Windows 10 “private.” Fortunately they don’t exist!\n\nI just wanted to say all of this (below, especially) because I don’t think I’m “qualified” to run Linux. I don’t really do coding/programming.\n\n16 years ago in college, I had one Computer Science class (I think it was C+?) that I passed with an above-average grade. These days, but rarely, I only tweak the CSS of my websites.\n\nI’m a bum-blogger that’s about to dive deeper into freelance writing.\n\nThings I usually do/use with my PC:\n\n* Firefox/Firefox Developer (in the process of getting rid of Chrome for good)\n* Wordpress\n* Youtube\n* MS (2010) Word, Excel\n* Cryptomator\n* 4 cloud-sync apps: Dropbox, Backup and Sync from Google, Sync, and pCloud\n* Skype\n* Calibre E-book Management\n* Zhorn Stickies\n* Microsoft OneNote\n* MPC-HC for movies\n* Windows Media Player for music\n* VPN (for the new laptop)\n* PayPal, online banking, etc.\n\nThey’re nothing fancy, I guess, but I use my PC for everything—work and personal stuff.\n\nI don’t do gaming, photoshop and video-editing.\n\nAnd because I’m overwhelmed, I’m sorry I need to state my units’ specs:\n\nMy 4+ y/o desktop PC: Windows 8.1, i5-4590 @ 3.30 GHz, x64-based processor, 8 GB RAM DDR3, 1 TB HDD.\n\nMy new laptop: Windows 10, i3-7020U @ 2.30 GHz, x64-based processor, 8 GB RAM DDR4, 1 TB HDD.\n\nI can’t believe Windows 10 is making me do this.

I even assume Windows is only gonna get worse—is this likely?\n\nThanks heaps for reading, TIA!", "output": "No advice from me, just encouragement; good on you for pursuing what you believe is right."}

You wrote your programs in some punched cards using a weird typewriter that punched the cards for you, then handled them to a secretary that would in turn handle them to the computer technician that would feed them to the computer.\n\nThe result would be printed out in a long sheet of striped paper and then handled back to you in the same desk you left your stack of cards with the secretary, with you never seeing the actual computer.\n\nHere is a video if you want to see one of them in action: [https://youtu.be/uFQ3sajIdaM](https://youtu.be/uFQ3sajIdaM)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, some folks wanted to improve that workflow. They looked at the teletext technology, that connects two typewriters so you can type in one and see the text in the other. It's like a telegraph, but without the need of knowing morse code.\n\nThey simply connected the computer to one of those teletype machines, and made a program so you could \"chat\" with the computer in real time. You wrote commands on the telex, and when you hit enter, the computer will process them and punch out the result in the same paper.\n\nThat even meant that the cumbersome way of handling the stacks of punched cards could be left out. Instead, one simply needed a teletype machine in a desk connected to the mainframe. And with the advent of multi-user operating systems, multiple teletypes could be interacting at the same time with the mainframe.\n\nHere is a video of a PDP-7 computer running UNIX version 0 (one of those multi user systems) with a teletype hooked up: [https://youtu.be/pvaPaWyiuLA](https://youtu.be/pvaPaWyiuLA)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith time the so called \"glass teletypes\" were developed. These replaced the slow typing head and the paper for a faster screen. They were still compatible with the telex technology and one in principle could hook one of these to other teletypes (glass or not) and see the text in the other one, but by that time the only use for telex machines were computer interaction.\n\nThe term \"terminal\" comes from this time, referring to the teletype as what lies in the termination of a wire coming out of the mainframe.\n\nEarly personal computers (like the Apple I) had an entire teletype inside all the circuitry.\n\nTTYs in modern linux distros are virtual ones, that connect to modern day keyboards and displays, but in the core they simulate a classic teletype machine (that is why they are often called virtual console).\n\nHere is a video of a madlad that connected a moden linux system to a 1930's teletype: [https://youtu.be/AwqryPuwl\\_w](https://youtu.be/AwqryPuwl_w)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Different TTYs simulate different teletypes connected to your computer. This is done In a very basic manner to ensure that even the most basic and resource scarce system has some way of using it.\n\nIf you go an install a bare minimum system (like the default installation fo Arch or a minimal Debian one) you will only have the TTYs to operate. No GUIs of some sort.\n\nWhat happens is that the GUI runs in one of those TTYs. You technically have 7 of them (F1 to F7), simply the GUI is using the seventh one. In other distros that is configured differently, for example, in Fedora TTY1 is the login screen and TTY2 is the GUI.\n\nGUIs are a modern invention aimed to make computers easier for the masses, but for more technical work, the terminal and it's command line is the best. It's like Spongebob's fishing net: Ol' Reliable.\n\nWhy 7? just becasue. It was just a number someone decided. Becasue in a terminal you don't have a native way to have two things shown up at the same time, often people used two different sessions in two teletypes, for example. When youa re in a TTY, use Alt + \\[Left/Right\\] to switch quicly between the next or previous TTY.\n\n\\*Thanks u/DeliriousSiren0 and u/InfanticideAquifier \\*\n\nBecause Linux TTYs are software emulated, one can add more, configure autologin in one of them, etc. More info in the all-mighty arch wiki: [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Getty](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Getty)\n\nEDIT: if I didn't bored you enough with my texts and nerdy videos, here is an article about it: [https://www.howtogeek.com/428174/what-is-a-tty-on-linux-and-how-to-use-the-tty-command/](https://www.howtogeek.com/428174/what-is-a-tty-on-linux-and-how-to-use-the-tty-command/)"}

There were several attempts to create better init systems like Ubuntu’s upstart service, and systemd is one such system, created for Fedora and Red Hat. It solved most aforementioned issues and established a new standard for creating and managing system services and is the standard init and service management system for most distributions.\n\nThere’s nothing “bad” about systemd: there was some push back because Linux users, especially system admins, don’t like people messing with their workflow, which the change to systemd did somewhat. Some vocal people in the community were dead set against it for a series of philosophical reasons. And because it was 2000s/early 2010s, the Linux community had a lot of hangers-on who didn’t really know much about the subject, but they enjoyed pontificating about it on Google Plus for clout. There were some people who actually went off and made their own systemd-free distros, but you rarely heard them wailing about how evil it was.

And I see a lot more posts here where folks know which program to use for whatever, but don't know \"man\" (manual) pages.\n\nI figured I'd just post this because I have actually \\[and finally\\] saved the method of exporting a man page to a text file. Which is now saved on my desktop next to a few man pages I had saved before.\n\nIn the terminal, type `man command_name > formatted_man_page.txt`. So, let's say we want to understand better how the `kill` command works, and why everyone is all about \"-9\".

You can then open it up with a text editor of your choice.\n\nIf you want to be more brutal (sorry, during these sequestering times, I've been watching some Metalcoalypse) and would prefer to stay in the terminal, Linux these days is super gracious.

Linux for all its quirks is a beautiful, rich system.\n\nThe thing is I feel like an idiot.  So many posters online are so skilled.  I've written extremely basic bash scripts, use CLI for simple file tasks, etc.  But I read a lot of folks who have such mastery.  It's intimidating, seeing folks argue with real knowledge about systemd--is it good or bad.  I use Gnome and some folks use workflow with i3 (I literally don't know how I'd do a non-DE install).  Or they complain about distro bloat with real sincerity and know how to cut and tailor their install to the bone.  Or replace drivers manually.  Or know all the vi shortcuts.  Or, shit, they'll play mp3s or launch movies from the command line.  I'm impressed by their fluency and achievement.\n\nHow does one take the leap from \"late noob\" or \"starting intermediate\" to the levels of expertise of a Linux pro?  Because it feels like a gap, like difference knowing a little restaurant Spanish and reading Cervantes.  Do you need to work as a sysAdmin for a few years?

How does it work under the hood?", "input": "Could someone also please explain the terms (if possible, provide examples) and show how they all are related:\n\n- hypervisor\n- QEMU\n- KVM\n- Docker", "output": "Mhhh...as always I will just completely ignore the ELI5 part. Sorry, but I don't really like using \"pictures\" that a five year old understands but that are ultimately wrong. Hope it's still not too complicated...\n\nFirst virtualization in general...this is important to understand the differences in the terms you asked for.\n\nAt it's core hardware virtualization is a pretty creative abuse of the computer [protection ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_ring) model of CPUs. Of course a bit simplified now (and pretty i386/amd64 specific, other CPUs have this of course too but the details can differ there) but it kind of works like this: CPUs have different rings/layers in which code can run and which allow different kinds of access. The linux kernel for example usually runs in ring 0 which gives it pretty much full access to the hardware while all applications run in ring 3 with serve limits to what they can do. Ring 3 applications don't get access for example to the registers that allow memory mapping, don't get access to the hardware ports that allow direct communication with peripheral devices and such things. If they need access to \"hardware\" they have to ask the kernel to do it for them which in return allows the kernel to mediate the access of all applications and prevent them getting in their ways. But the interesting part about this is what happens if a ring 3 applications still tries to execute  a machine command it isn't allow to run...in that case the CPU throws and error in form of an interrupt. Simplified interrupts are \"functions\" that can be thrown at any time and that break the currently running code and are executed before the control is handed back to the program. And well....the fun part of them is that you can write your code that should run as interrupt. The linux kernel makes use of that in plenty of places...I think an easy example is swapping. If a program wants to access memory that is currently not in RAM but swapped out the CPU throws an interrupt...and the linux kernel modified that interrupt to fetch the data from disk back into memory then hands control back over to the program ...ta da...seamless swapping without the program even noticing (other than it taking pretty long that it got its data).\n\nSo now....what would happen if we catch the interrupts for every command ran by a ring 3 application that they aren't allowed to do but in the interrupt instead of doing some error handling like killing the program put code to emulate all those commands and have them act as if the succeed...just on some emulated system. That is at the very core what hardware virtualization does. We run a complete operating system in unprivileged ring 3, something that shouldn't be possible by default as the OS needs direct hardware access. But every time the OS does this we redirect its calls to some emulation layer we control. Theoretically the OS never notices this (not completely true, there are way to detect this) and most of the time everything runs at full speed on the CPU as it is executed just the same as any other program. Only in cases where it needs access to privileged functions that usually must be ran in a higher ring the emulation layer kicks in.\n\nAnd just to repeat it..this is all pretty simplified...and not completely true anymore. This is how hardware virtualization started but by now CPU offer specif CPU instructions and structure to help this and make it even faster. But the basics are still pretty much the same.\n\nNow with this in mind to your terms:\n\n**Hypervisor**: Kind of an layer that coordinates hardware access between the different running virtual machines (the systems \"emulated\"). In the explanation above we assumed that every access a virtual machines does ends up emulated...but that is not really what we want all the time. Lets take USB for example...pretty sure that we want to be able to give our OSes access to usb sticks or such. But now we run into a little problem...sure our virtualization software could just run the exact commands the OS uses to access the USB hardware and by this basically hand over the control over the hardware to the virtual OS. But then this hardware MUST be blocked from anything else accessing it. The virtual OS assumes it has full and only access to the hardware...a second virtual machine (or the host OS, the OS originally running on the machine) could badly mess up there. Not sure how to make this clear...lets assume our virtual machine is just in the process of writing to the hardware...and it already send the command that says where to write to the hardware but hasn't started writing yet. Now a second \"system\" access the same hardware...and also sends a command to set the position to write too...as soon as the first system gets it's turn again it will assume that the command it already sent is still valid...while in reality the hardware thinks it is writing to a different place already...madness ensured.\n\nSo hypervisors add a new layer of abstraction there that allow controlled access to hardware. As they are \"part\" of the virtualization solution they know exactly what commands the virtual machines try to run right now...and in the simplest case could just block any other access until a point they now the hardware is in a consitent state and can be accessed by \"someone\" else. In more complex cases they could keep a \"status\" of the hardware for every virtual machine and restore the exact status before handing over the control.\n\n**qemu**: This one is actually interesting as it is \"older\" than the modern hardware virtualization. (yeah, yeah...I know...concept of hardware virtualization is pretty old so not that sure if qemu is really older. But it is older than vmware which as far as I know was the first that made hardware virtualization feasible and popular). Qemu is a \"real\" emulator...it has kind of a plugin structure that allow it to have plugins for different CPUs and originally completely emulated every CPU command that ran on those CPUs in software. That makes it possible to run programs form CPUs that differ from the actually installed CPU....just at snail speed ;) But by now of course there were \"plugins\" written that use hardware virtualization as described above...so qemu can virtualize the same CPU as said above (at almost full speed). So qemu can be both...a way to run arm code on x86 or to create virtual x86 machines...for the later is uses kvm\n\n**kvm**: Is a hypervisor in the linux kernel. It's basically a service the linux kernel offers to programs like qemu to hand access of hardware to virtual machines. \n\n**docker**: Okay...now entering docker. I hope by now it is somewhat clear what hardware virtualization does. When it first appeared it was celebrated not only because of the possibility to run a complete different OS on another one...but also because it isolates that virtual OS. The virtual OS only sees what the hypervisor shows it...it can't mess with any other virtual OS running on the same machine. And as soon as server admins hear isolation they get a h....lets me say that differently...server admins really like it when they have the means to completely isolate one service of a server from another. The email server could run amok and claim all the system memory...bringing down the dns server running on the same machine as well. But now they have a technology that allows them to say that each virtual machine can only use up to 2gb of memory, never the whole memory. Sure...let the email server run amok...at least my dns server still does its work. Sounds great..doesn't it? But damn....virtual machines are complicated...for each one I have to install a complete OS and set it up. We are on linux anyway...why do I need to install 5 other complete linux systems and set them up just in order to get this kind of isolation. And here comes docker...thanks to the years of researching and using virtual machines lots of work went into better isolation of the systems as well. What if we only use those isolation features...and throw out all that hardware virtualization stuff? Of course docker people will crucify me for this now..but that is pretty much what docker/containers do. They still use the same OS kernel as the host system but then create isolated environments  on the host OS that can't interfere with each other. Lots of this comes from virtual machines...but the core functionality why virtual machines were created in the first place got thrown overboard. This make them the solution that fits server better, has lesser overhead, still offers reasonable isolation (but also has drawbacks of course...a bug in the linux kernel itself can bring down all services while in virtual machines it only brings down the single virtual machine running the kernel that ran in the bug)\n\n*edit: typos*  \n*edit2: Nobody called me out about applications running in ring 2? ;) of course it's ring 3*"}

You could argue that I should donate the most to the project that I use the most (in this case distro and DE), but the problem with that approach is that I feel those projects already get a ton of support (relatively) and maybe I should focus my efforts on the (seemingly) small proejcts that everyone ignores.\n\nThe problem with the latter approach is that, well $X isn't a lot, and I'm giving a fraction of that to a small project.  It really isn't enough to sustain the project by any means.  While I'm sure the gesture will be appreciated, I'm wondering if it will do any good?  \n\nAlso, what if these projects close, now I need to find an alternative and I'm out of cash also.

I found a subreddit and was exploring i.e. r/unixporn. As I tried to copy the way some looks were, they gave links to GitHub (idk what that is) and something called 'dotfiles'.As a Windows user, I used to customize using Rainmeter, and as with any windows thing, I just hit install and went through the options of customization after installation. But I have no idea how to achieve customization in Linux given its technical modes. Like what are dotfiles and compositor, what am I supposed to do with them, will there be a menu to customize or do I have to write lines of code, what is GitHub etc. After using Linux I realized that what as an average bloke one thinks of one's system is actually a finished product, i.e. I used to think that the entire UI, the file manager, the taskbar (panel) is the OS, but after using Linux, I realized that those things are separate, and I'd just like to learn more and learn to use them. Thank you :)", "output": "Each program likely has its own configuration for visuals. KDE makes some of it easier but providing a settings panel, but many programs use files for configuration, often called \"dotfiles\" because they are usually files that start with a period (or they're in folders that start with a period), which your file browser will hide by default. If you go into your home folder and enable hidden files, you might be able to start opening some and take a peek at how you might configure some of them. People use GitHub because it makes it easy to track these files and show them to other people. Lucky for you, this means you can compare your dotfiles with those from other users on GitHub!\n\nEDIT: Some other notes:\n\nA desktop environment is a collection of programs, usually containing a Window Manager, which does nothing more but tell the computer where to position the windows on screen, and a compositor, which will hook into the computer to tell it how to render the windows. A compositor is not necessary, but you do need it for nice graphical effects like shadows.\n\nKDE has those and much much more to make it a very full desktop environment."}

You should probably spend a few minutes on the web and find a tutorial on basic Linux drive and file system management.\n\nSome points:\n\n1. \"Fixed\" drives (vs. removable) should be mounted using /etc/fstab and unless they have a special purpose they should be mounted to locations under /mnt/. This is all about organization and following standards. Of course, it is *your* system and you're free to do as you please but the farther you wander from expected norms the more likely you are to encounter problems.\n2. When using /etc/fstab to mount file systems you need to learn a bit about mount options to both optimize the file system but also ease access. For example, using the options \"user\" and/or \"users\" will allow you to mount and unmount those file systems without \"sudo\" and a password.\n3. \"/media/<username>\" is where the system automounts removable devices. Mucking about there will likely result in your thumb drives not being mounted anymore.\n4. If you are using EXT4 you need to modify the ownership of the file system the first time you mount it so your user can easily access it. If you have multiple users, you'll want to consider group permission and access rather than user level ownership.\n5. EXT4 also reserves 5% of the total space for \"system\" use which is an antiquated default on only marginally necessary on a bootable file system and not at all on a file system used only for storage. You should free all the reserved space on storage file systems with \"sudo tune2fs -m 0 /dev/sdX1\" substituting your partition device name for \"sdX1\".\n6. File systems are \"easier\" to access in Windows because Windows default controls are inherently unsafe. That's why a virus can wipe your file systems in Windows but hasn't ever happened when using Linux."}

I play with computers but it's obvious why this was never a career.\n\nYour experience will depend on the Linux distribution you choose. Linux is sort-of the core brains of the system, but it gets adapted into all sorts of distributions (think of them like \"versions\") for different purposes. There's family trees that show how different versions evolved from prior versions. But for basic desktop use, most of that won't matter because the system will manage that stuff for you.\n\nFor basic desktop use, I like Ubuntu. It's based on Debian, which is a very stable foundation, but is very user-oriented. It has a good software manager. Other similar versions are Mint or Peppermint, and each has it's niche.\n\nOthers like OpenSUSE, which I used to love, but that was probably because they have a cool logo. I really don't know much else about how it's come along. Fedora is the community edition of Red Hat, which is one of the early big names in Linux. Any web search for \"linux distributions for new users\" or something like that will give you some rundowns on the options.\n\nI would avoid ones like Arch, Slack, or Gentoo, that I think require more technical expertise.\n\nThere are really tons of versions for different purposes. Have an old computer that can't keep up? Try Damn Small Linux or such. Do you want something that is plug-and-play, or lets you dig under the hood?\n\nIf you're really nervous, you can download Ubuntu and put on a DVD or flash drive, and I think when that boots up, it gives you a choice to try it or install. Or setup a virtual machine on your PC and try all sorts of Linux distributions - try one, dump it, and try another.\n\nThe main thing to remember is it's all same but different. Like how when Microsoft upgrades Windows or Excel, and everyone loses their mind because it doesn't look quite the same. It still does all the same stuff, and a little thinking will get you there. So instead of Microsoft Office, you might use Libre Office. Still does word processing and spreadsheets, but maybe options are under the Format menu instead of File.\n\nThere will be problems, just like with anything else in computers. If you stay in the mainline distributions, a web search usually finds lots of resources from people that have had that problem before you."}

{"id": "9k7som", "instruction": "Why do some files (usually files not native to Linux, like a .txt, or a code file like .py) have file endings? Most other files in Linux don't, so why do some files have them, and why does Linux know what to do with them?", "input": "So I was taught that files in Linux don't need file endings like in Windows because every file has an identifier on it's first line (if you think of the file as a text document, which all files can be. a non-text file will just be garbled text though) that lets the OS recognize the file as a picture or text file or whatever. \n\nBut some files, usually ones that I've sent to my Linux from my Windows (like a .jpg) or a code file, retain their file endings. Moreover, the file endings actually have some impact on how Linux views them (the file endings aren't just viewed as part of the file name). For example, changing a .py file to a .class file will actively make Linux interpret that file as a file containing code for Java and not Python.\n\nI'd think that Linux doesn't even have the ability to identify files based on the extension in their name, since it doesn't need to do that (since identifiers are in the files anyways). So what's going on here? Why does changing the file ending do anything, when Linux doesn't rely on file endings at all?", "output": "For the why, two reasons, makes it easier for humans to identify a file just by looking at the filename but also useful for programs to the same kind of file but with different purpose. Java sourcecode, python sourcecode, c++ sourcecode...that are all just text. And identifying the exact programming language in them can be complicated (java and c++ have a lot of keywords in common, it's no trivial to see if a program is written for Java or c++). So by having file extensions it is a lot easier for editors to turn on the correct syntax highlighting for a specific language for example.\n\nSo, why do people always say that linux (unix) has no file extensions? Well, because there really aren't any...You have one filename and that filename can end in dot-something but it has no special meaning at all. It's not like the FAT filesystem where each file has a filename and an extra data field for the extension. The file extension in unix filesystems is simply a part of the filename. And file extensions don't have to be done by \".<something>\"...for example vim creates backup files simply by adding a \"~\" at the end of the filename. The \"extension\" in this case is only \"~\" without any dot.\n\nThe traditional way of identifying a file on unix is by \"magic numbers\". You have a long list of \"byte combinations\" and something reads the start of a file then compares it to that list to see what the file really is. The `file` tool for example does this...you can have a look at the magic number list in `/usr/share/misc/magic`. That folder has text files for all filetypes `file` can identify which tell `file` what numbers it has to find in the start of a file to identify it as this filetype.\n\nBut that is not the end of it....nowadays there is a second system for identifying files: shared-mime-info. This is mostly used by DEs and their programs. And mimetypes defined by this database can either be defined again by magic numbers but also by filename patterns. The database files for this system you can fin in `/usr/share/mime` (or if you modify them on your user account in `~/.local/share/mime`). And if you look at examples there most contain a `<glob pattern=\"*.png\"/>` line or similar. That means  any program using the mimetype database will identify png images by matching he filename against a \"*.png\" pattern. Filename matching is simply faster than having to open a file and look at the start...so for your filemanager being able to display the \"filetype\" column in time this is nicer...even if it doesn't guarantee that the file is really a png image."}

Much thanks to all who have responded and contributed with your opinions and wisdom.\n\n**Requirements**\n\n1. Automatic weekly or monthly security updates in the background allowed, just not daily or every few days. If the Linux distro has some background updaters configured out of the box, without me having to create a cron job, that'll be great. If they do not have notifications that keep harassing me to do a system update with a pop-up message dialog or red bubble, that's good.\n2. No new software or feature upgrades. Those are not needed.\n3. Security updates for 10 years so that I am not forced to do an OS re-installation every 3 to 5 years. For example, even LTS like Ubuntu or Debian would go out of support without security updates unless I subscribe to Ubuntu Pro or  Debian Long Term Support as a commercial paid service.\n4. No paid subscription to commercial service for extended support. Those services are probably targeted at businesses running critical services and servers. For my case, it's simply for a family desktop PC that I don't want to keep touching or maintaining.\n\n**Notable changes**\n\n1. Previously, I gave the impression that I do not even allow security updates or any changes to the OS at all. So that raised a lot of concerns about leaving an unpatched system connected to Internet.\n2. Previously, I set a period of up to 20 years to be sure that the hardware is definitely outdated/dead by then, which many feel is unrealistic. I agree and have reduced my expectation to a maximum of 10 years.\n\n**Personal comments from replies**\n\nJust to share my current thoughts after going through the replies.\n\n1. I am currently inclined towards *Alma Linux*, *Rocky Linux* or *Oracle Linux* in a workstation setup since they seem to focus on 10 year support cycle. All *Debian*-based distributions seem to be capped at 5 years.\n2. Although RHEL is free for non-commercial users, I prefer not to have to provide my email to Red Hat to register an account just to download RHEL for home use. Just inconvenience to me.\n3. Initially, I would have gone with the easy to install distributions like *Ubuntu* or *Linux Mint* if I could, but they're all capped at 5 years of support. So they're placed as backup options.\n4. I am still open to rolling release distributions like *openSUSE Tumbleweed* if they simply get updated over time with no intervention. But I do not wish to troubleshoot random bugs or issues that happen when something worked yesterday and not today due to a new software update that happens overnight. \n5. I have placed *Slackware* and *Arch* as backup option simply because they are less well-known or used. I do not know enough of their package manager or other problems that I may face. And I am not a tinkerer like most *Arch* users are. Also, official *Slackware* package tools *do not handle dependencies*.\n\n>!~~I do not wish to have to keep reinstalling a new version every 2 to 3 years or 5 years.

Recently Id installed a custom ROM on my phone, and after taking that  little jump I feel like I should do the same for my computers operating  system.\n\nDuring  my research (including the 'Guide: Migrating to Linux in 2020' from the Linux Gaming sub ) Ive  been getting a lot of information and quite frankly its all very  confusing. After looking at some beginner related content it seems like  Ive been directed towards certain linux distros like PopOS, Manjaro,  Fedora, Endeavour, Mint and a couple of others were also mentioned. I  did a little research and it seems like these recommended beginner  distros have very wide variances in terms of complexity which has lead  to more confusion on my end. I do want to learn about Linux and gain  knowledge, but I dont want to be upsold to something thats so complex in  an attempt to give me a trial by fire to force me to learn. Oh, I also  want to be able to access a supportive community if something is wrong  or I mess something up, this kinda leads me to want a more \"popular\"  distro.\n\nFor instance, distros like  Manjaro get recommended a lot but Ive also read a lot of stuff  (comments on various threads for Linux Noobs) about how it breaks a lot  and how that makes it unsuitable for beginners. This makes me anxious  that if I use this distro that Ill constantly be at risk for breaking my  computer. I dont want the possibility that Ill accidentally break  something and then have to reinstall the OS or something like that.  Likewise with Arch, which I also see simultaneously get recommended by  noobs but also get the reputation of being the most complex. Maybe in  the future I could move on to Arch but I dont want to be dropped into  the deep end when all I want at the moment is to move away from Windows.  Of course Im a complete noob so I dont know whether any of these  comments are actually accurate as I have no basis of comparison.\n\nIll  say that just based on reputation it seems like PopOS and Manjaro are  the most recommended to beginners, alongside Mint and Ubuntu. Among  these which would be best? I have tried researching but theres so much I  dont understand that any choice I make now would be completely  uninformed.\n\nThere are requirements  I have for an operating system, mainly that its stable and doesnt break  itself. I dont want the anxiety that my files might get fucked up or  that Ill mess something up and have to spend lots of time fixing minor  issues all the time. Privacy and Security are natural concerns but I  feel like that fact its not Windows makes any Linux automatically better  at these things. And generally I want it to be smooth and fast, I dont  expect Linux to be any less so than Windows which already feels clunky  to me.\n\nMy  use case is that I mainly use my computer for browsing the internet  (usually I use a bunch of tabs because Im a tab hoarder), chatting on  discord, seeding torrents, watching movies on VLC and playing games from  Steam (usually not the newest AAA though) and I dont really expect to  do much else other than this. I want to be able to play both Steam games  and non-steam games (Wow, ESO, FFXIV, Apex, Uplay etc), I also want to  be able to use Tor, my VPN, Bitwarden, and some light word processing.

TBH, I'm a little tired of seeing the same questions being asked, so this is also a post that can be quickly and easily linked to when needed. Also, it is fucking hard to write this shit without bias. If you notice any, point it out and I'll remove it.\n\nI have not really seen any good guides for Linux for new users coming from Windows, who are accustomed to the Windows way of doing things. so without further ado, let's get started learning Linux. Please point out errors and suggest ways to make it better.\n\nNew users, please give feedback (I wrote this especially for you guys ;)). What things could be explained better? What things are explained well? Are any vital topics missing?\n\nupdate: I am probably going to just update a wiki I made on reddit and post major milestones when they are ready on /r/linux4noobs \n\nsee it at: https://pay.reddit.com/r/LinuxEvolved/wiki/linuxbasics\n\n-----\n\nI'm not going to BS or kick around the bush for why you might want to use Linux. You are here, and you are reading, so keeping going. You may notice that I mostly do not go into specifics on how to do the things I say. This is because each and every distribution is different and the ways to do things are constantly changing. Also, it gives you a chance to use Google and learn to do it yourself which is an important lesson to be learned in life.\n\nUsually to find out how to do something it is as easy as searching for \"[insert distribution name here] [insert distribution version here] [what you want to do] [the name of the thing]\". For example, \"opensuse install catalyst\". If you don't find that answer after searching for at least 5 minutes, try asking on your distributions specific forums like the Ubuntu forums for Ubuntu distributions. Also feel free to post your question to /r/linux4noobs or /r/linuxquestions.\n\nAdditionally, whenever I say \"Linux\", I am probably referring to the Linux platform as a whole, and not just the kernel.\n\n###The nature of Linux\n\nTo get a feel for the biggest difference between Windows and Linux, one needs to understand that Linux is not just one piece of software written by a single person or company, it is actually a bunch of different software written by a bunch of different people and companies. Because of this, it is often possible to use, substitute or not use at all, most software on Linux. If one does not want to display any graphics, Linux allows users to do that. If one does not want audio, it not need need to be installed. If one does not like the audio server, it can be changed. The same applies for software like file managers. For example, on Windows, the file manager, or the program which allows the user to browse their computer for files and folders is called Explorer. That is the one and only option for browsing files and folders on Windows. However, on Linux, there are more choices than anyone can list.\n\n###Look and feel\n\nWhy did I just explain all that? Because one of the first things people notice about Linux is that there are a bunch of different versions of Linux. Ubuntu, Debian and Red Hat to list a few, are all names a bunch of people have heard, yet they all look very different. This is because under Linux, the users have the choice as to what Desktop Environment they wish to use. A desktop environment is simply the software which handles the various menus and panels on the computer. Desktop environments usually also bundle in software like file managers and media players. On Windows, this would be the task bar, start menu and the title bars on the windows of various programs. Popular desktop environments on Linux are KDE, Gnome, XFCE and LXDE. Desktop environments like Unity on Ubuntu and Cinnamon on Mint are almost completely exclusively found on those distributionbutions. Most often, users pick their desktop environment by picking a specific version of the distribution that includes it by default.\n\nSo if a user wanted to use XFCE, that user would pick a distribution, or a version of a distribution that uses that desktop environment by default. In the case of the Ubuntu family of distributions, they would opt for Xubuntu if they wanted XFCE. It is possible to change the desktop environment after installation, but this can sometimes get a little hairy for new users.\n\n###The package manager\n\nAfter you get passed the different looks and flavors of Linux, you must understand that the way in which software is installed on Linux is very different from how it is installed on Windows. On Windows, software is traditionally installed by downloading an exe or msi file and running it. On Linux, the process of downloading and installing software is usually completely automatic. The programs that handle this are called package managers. Each distribution usually has its own package manager. Package managers download software from package repositories.\n\nNew users would be advised to start out using a GUI front-end to handle updating, installing and removing software. Distributions like Ubuntu and OpenSUSE have GUI front-ends for their package managers which makes them easy to use for new users. Most, if not all the software a person needs is probably available in the repositories. New users should try to stick to using software found in the repositories.\n\n##Some quick tips:\n\n* \"Chrome\" is probably not in the repo, instead look for \"chromium\"\n* Most distributions come with Firefox installed by default, except Debian (ugh...), where it is instead called and branded as \"Iceweasel\"\n* To get flash working, install it from the package manager. Ubuntu distributions require a repo that contains closed source to be enabled for it can be downloaded called multiverse. This can be enabled in a menu somewhere. If you can't figure it out from the GUI, search for \"ubuntu enable multiverse\".\n* Eventually, when you become a little more comfortable with the terminal, it is often easier and faster to use it to update the system. The GUI utilities for system tasks on Linux tend to be lackluster. Do not fear, it is very easy to do, and completely optional if you don't want to use it.\n\n###Distributions\n\nA distribution of Linux is simply a collection of software put together by a company or group of people to form an entire operating system. As I have stated earlier, the parts of Linux can be switched out for other parts, but not everyone has the time to do that, or even wants to do that. This is one of the first things that the different distributions do that differentiate them.\n\nSome distributions pride themselves on stability, Debian, while others pride themselves on giving support for a really, really long time, Red Hat/CentOS. Other distributions like Fedora are known to use the latest and greatest of whatever is available, albeit sometimes at the cost of ease of use. Some distributions are what is called rolling release, meaning that as individual software gets updated, it is also updated in the repositories. Distributions that do this are often more difficult to use and are known to occasionally break on updates. It is for these reasons that beginners are advised to not pick a rolling release distribution. Examples of rolling release distributions are Arch Linux and Gentoo.\n\nWhat distribution should you pick? New users should pick an easy to use distribution like OpenSUSE or some distribution in the Ubuntu family.\n\nPopular distributions (common faults in parenthesis):\n\n* Ubuntu (included ads by default, this pisses off a bunch of privacy advocates and makes the system look ugly IMO)\n* Fedora (6 month release cycles can get tiring, and the distribution as a whole does not ever seem to be particularly well tested)\n* OpenSUSE (not as popular as other distributions)\n* Mint (besides cinnamon, there is nothing you get here that you can't get from Ubuntu and Debian. Also, I have found that they do some fairly back handed things with Firefox, so I personally avoid it)\n* Debian (difficult to use for new users, and the packages tend to be a bit older)\n\nadvanced(listed easiest to hardest):\n\n* Arch Linux\n* Slackware (you might get called a neck beard using this or Gentoo)\n* Gentoo\n\n###LiveCD\n\nOne unique thing Linux can do that Window can not easily do is run \"live\" directly off of a CD/DVD or USB drive without being installed to the hard drive. This allows users to try out Linux before they decide to fully commit or partially commit (dual booting). Off the top of my head, Fedora, Ubuntu and OpenSUSE offer to run live off the same disc/image that are used to install them. To do so, just click the button that says \"try it\" or something similar.\n\n##Gaming on Linux\n\nAt this time and your likely level of knowledge of Linux, native Steam should be easy enough to install, but beyond that and what is offered by sites like the Humble Bundle will probably be a little hard to get working. Games that do not have Linux versions can sometimes still be run on Linux, sometimes perfectly, sometimes with problems with a program called Wine. What Wine does is it gives Windows programs an environment that has everything it needs.\n\nIntel and AMD/ATI open source drivers should be fine for less demanding games. Nvidia users should probably always use the proprietary drivers. AMD/ATI users should use the catalyst drivers if they find that performance in a game is not as good as they would like. The many people consider the closed source catalyst drivers to be bad for everything except where excellent graphical performance is required.\n\nThe last I checked, crossfire and SLI do not work at all under Linux and laptops with optimus are a PITA.\n\n##Sources for games\n\nObviously Steam comes to mind first, but let's explore different sources for games. The Humble Indie Bundle was one of the original big time pushers for getting games on the Linux platform. Before that there were a few studios and publishers which did support Linux. More recently GOG, Good Old Games has announced that Linux would be a platform they support. As of writing this, it has not yet happened, although I am sure they will go through with that since they seem to be a decent company. There are also a few free games included in most repositories. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_video_games) has a list of open source games, some of which may be in the repositories.\n\nA not so obvious source of games that many people forget works great on Linux is emulating consoles. Most emulators are open source software and run well on Linux. Fifth generation (PSX, N64, etc...) and earlier consoles should run great on any modern hardware and sixth generation (PS2, GC, etc...) consoles are pretty damn good. Most distributions include these emulators in their repositories. You can find the names of popular emulators on [Emulator Zone](http://www.emulator-zone.com/) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_emulators)\n\n###Getting help\n\nAt some point or another, everyone meets their match and must ask for help. There are a lot of people willing to help the noobs, but many won't be so happy if you make it hard for them to help, or if you are annoying or break the rules of the service you use to ask for help.\n\nHere is a quick list of things you should do:\n\n* include distro name, and version and major changes you did to it that may not be obvious or popular. For example, I use Arch Linux x86_64 with multiarch enabled. If you used Debian, you would say something like \"Debian sid x86_64\"\n* include hardware if you think it might be at all relevant. If you don't know, include it anyway.\n* speak proper english\n* include logs and try to describe the problem as best as you can.\n* did you try restarting?\n* read the damn stickies (and on reddit, the sidebar), follow the rules.\n* have you read the manual/documentation? Often if you point out something you don't understand in the documentation, people will be glad to help because it shows you are trying.\n\nDO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING:\n\n* post questions on /r/linux, they belong on /r/linux4noobs or /r/linuxquestions\n* be rude. but if someone is rude to you and you were nice, ~~tell them to fuck off~~ ignore them.", "output": "Be sure to suggest topics, I have no idea what to do next, but some of my ideas are:\n\n* Getting and Installing Linux - the general process for downloading and installing Linux.\n* Wine - this one would go into detail as to what wine does and how to do common tasks with it, including what and how to use prefixes, and how to use winetricks and look up information in the DB.\n* Software for Linux - basically, this one would be a bigass list of categorized software. [Click here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications) to see what I would base it off of. Mine would be trimmed down and include some stuff not listed there, but that list should be good for anyone.\n* Distributions in detail (This one would require a lot of time to write, because I would have to test each one I write about since I only use Arch and Fedora on a regular basis) It would go into detail about each of the popular ones, and the different versions and major features of each and a rough history.\n\nI want to keep this style of guide, saying how things work in a nutshell, instead of step-by-step type guides because they tend not to work across distributions and often change over time.\n\nIf popularity persists, I will probably go up to basic Bash scripting.\n\nedit: haha, forgot a massive source of thousands of games that all run on Linux perfectly. EMULATION. Most emulators are open source and work fantastic on Linux. I will update the guide to include this under gaming. I think the next guide will just be games on Linux in general and will include Wine among other things."}

Pacscripts need to go through two layer security check. We use pacscript to install the package using workflows and in VMs to ensure that all pacscripts are safe and don't cause any harm to your system. You can submit pacscripts by creating a pull request. You can be sure that your system will not have any issues when installing package using pacstall. \n\nPacstall contains many packages that are not in apt repos or require using PPAs. It also has packages like neovim-git which requires manual compiling. \n\n# Hmm, looks interesting. Tell more. \nWe have released version 1.5 of Pacstall yesterday. It introduced some of the best features we can ever imagine. Sneak peek of some features:\n\n* Parallel downloads using ```aria2```\n\n* Multi repo support\n\n* Support for ```.deb``` files, and so much more....\n\nEdit: You can create your own repo and use it to install packages from pacscripts.", "output": "Is there a relationship between this and the Debian User Repository project?"}

Thanks!", "output": "Set it up as your daily driver, and learn things you don't know.  \n  \nIf you're usually a Windows user, take note of the 5 most common things you do in Windows, and learn how to do them in linux."}

{"id": "xglucn", "instruction": "Are Terminal commands the same for all Linux distros? If not, what makes them differ?", "input": "Well, this question is as noob as it gets. I recently switched to Ubuntu from Windows and I started learning the command line in Terminal, just the basic stuff - how to change directories, how to setup git, how to install, remove etc. However, I don't like Ubuntu mainly because of snaps and I want to change distro to something different. I plan to check out all the major players - Fedora, Debian, Arch etc. I fear the knowledge I gained so far will go down the drain and I'll have to start again. An example of what I mean:\n\n- Ubuntu/Debian use sudo apt update;\n- Manjaro/Arch  use sudo pacman;\n- CentOS uses sudo yum update;\n\nCan someone explain this to me in as ELI5 way as possible?", "output": "The knowledge you’ve gained so far will still be relevant across the different distros(the basic stuff, changing directories and such)… the commands you’ve listed here are package managers that are specific to those distros."}
