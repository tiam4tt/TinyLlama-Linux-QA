This *currently* seems to cause issues with some configurations, but should otherwise and in the future be a good thing for performance. Setting the `nvidia` kernel module parameter `NVreg_EnableGpuFirmware=0` (which you may do using the kernel command line as OP and I did) forces this feature off again, and therefore may resolve those issues. See Nvidia's Linux driver documentation chapter on the GSP for [version 555](https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/555.58.02/README/gsp.html) and the previous [version 550](https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/550.90.07/README/gsp.html). I can't currently find out anything more about where exactly the problem lies.\n\nYou may wish to check if you are currently using the GSP. Per Nvidia's documentation, the output of `nvidia-smi -q` should include a key \"GSP Firmware Version\", with the value `N/A` if GSP is currently *disabled* and a version value like `550.90.07` if it's *enabled*. So, run something like `nvidia-smi -q | grep GSP`.\n\nTo reiterate what I did to fix the issue on my end, risking excessive detail because I'm always frustrated with how little detail/explanations other people provide:\n\n1. Edit `/etc/default/grub`. Find the key `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`. To the end of the existing string value add a space and `nvidia.NVreg_EnableGpuFirmware=0`. This means specifying the `nvidia` kernel module parameter mentioned on the kernel command line, although just editing this file doesn't actually change the grub configuration yet; it influences the generation of a new one.\n2. In case something goes wrong, save a copy of my current `/boot/grub/grub.cfg`, as I'm about to overwrite this file.\n3. Run `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg` (with sudo). This generates a new grub config, using the change I made to `/etc/default/grub`, and outputs it to the location expected by grub.\n\nArguably the nicer way to do it would be using a configuration file in `/etc/modprobe.d/`. At least I don't see why that shouldn't be equivalent. But it's not what I did and I'm too lazy to check if it actually does what I expect."}

Benefits: its easy, Problems: Audio wont work, very likely to mess up disk partition in the TUI, and sometimes it forgets to install GRUB (the bootloader).\n\nEndeavourOS is arch with a GUI Installer, just like Linux Mint.

I think pewdiepie caused newbies to hop onto mint and 2 days later they go straight to arch, when I first used linux i was on mint, and then I used debian for a good while, and then I went onto fedora, and arch, and then finally, arco linux (arcolinux is shut down, but the dev is awesome and he released 4 new isos to save our ass)\n\n  \n**NOTE: FOR A FANCIER BLACK SCREEN, BOOT UP THE ISO,** `sudo pacman -S python-pywal` **, THEN** `curl -L` [`https://picsum.photos/800/600`](https://picsum.photos/800/600) `-o random.jpg` , **THEN** `wal -i random.jpg`"}
