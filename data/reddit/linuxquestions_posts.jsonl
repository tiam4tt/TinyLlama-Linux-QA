Learning to use Linux is like experiencing computers for the first time again, a lot of your knowledge about Windows can be thrown out the window and you get to rediscover what makes computing fun again. Unfortunately, getting started with Linux can be overwhelming for newcomers, with a lot of choices to select from but a lack of knowledge to make the right choice for yourself.\n\nLately there's been an influx of people who are installing Kali as their daily driver, main Linux distribution to use for desktop usage; asking questions that are a direct result of misunderstanding what Kali is for and ignoring the strong advice of the distribution to not use it that way. Such questions are a waste of everyone time's including your own, but more importantly, may discourage you from trying to use Linux again by assuming that that is the normal experience.\n\n**Why shouldn't I install Kali?**\n\nDo not just take my word for it, read the documentation: https://docs.kali.org/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux\n\nBut in short: Kali Linux is a hyper specialized distribution meant for security experts, penetration testers and the likes. It is not meant to be used as a general purpose operating system. The ideal way to use Kali Linux is from an USB stick or, even better, a virtual machine. Kali is more like a tool suite than an operating system.\n\n**I want a secure distro and Kali is a security distro!**\n\nKali Linux is not a secure distribution of Linux in the defensive sense, it is an *offensive* security distribution. The tools that it comes with are specifically meant to attack networks. The tools Kali Linux comes with are dangerous, and if used improperly can even lead *to serious legal consequences.*\n\nIf you want a secure defensive Linux distribution, you have many alternatives such as *Parrot Home Edition* as an example.\n\n**I watched Mr Robot and I want to become a cool hackerman and you're wrong so I'm going to do it anyway.**\n\nGo ahead, no one is stopping you from throwing caution to the wind. The best case scenario is that you'll get bored of it within a few hours, the worst case scenario is that you think this is what Linux is about. It's not, Linux is normally very convenient and easy to work with, read on to learn more.\n\nFurthermore, do not expect to get any help. The people in r/kalilinux will mock you for ignoring the documentation; and people here will most likely tell you to install something else.\n\n**Okay, I tried it and my infosec dreams are shattered, I hacked my local coffeeshop's wifi and got arrested, and I cannot use computers anymore.**\n\nI warned you!!\n\n**What Linux distribution should I actually install if I am new to Linux?**\n\nGenerally speaking, Ubuntu is highly recommended to newcomers as this is the most supported distribution by most third party software developers like Valve, Discord and many others. It is very popular and you will have the most luck finding solutions to issues you are likely to run into as many people will have had the same problems you did.\n\nThat said, Linux distributions come in many shapes, sizes, flavors and colors and you are encouraged to experiment and try for yourself. Some other distributions that are suitable for beginners (though some are easier than others) are:\n\n- Linux Mint\n- Pop_OS!\n- Manjaro Linux\n- OpenSuSE\n- Fedora Linux\n- Debian\n\nGood luck in your Linux journey!\n\nOld post\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRepeat after me:\n\n * Kali Linux is for pentesters, you are not to install it, the documentation for Kali tells you this.\n * If you think you'd like to use Kali as a desktop OS, you aren't ready to use an OS like Kali in any capacity.\n * No, you're not cool for installing Kali, it doesn't make you a hacker, just install Ubuntu.\n\nFeel free to `sed s/Kali/Parrot/` too, and any other pentesting, security oriented OS.", "output": "Well, Parrot is an exception as they make a \"home edition\" which removes the pentesting tools, but still has the privacy features like sandboxing and AnonSurf.\n\nOther than that, I agree with you.\n\nEdit: Also replace Ubuntu with Debian, as it is the distro most pentesting distros are based on anyways."}

Totally unintuitive, but everybody's used to these combinations, so they count as a \"friendly\" combination.\n\nSo when somebody comes to vi and finds that it's `d` to cut, and `p` to paste, it's not considered friendly: It's not what anybody is used to.\n\nIs it superior? Well, actually, yes. \n\nWith the `Ctrl-X` approach, how do you cut a word from the document you're currently in? (No using the mouse!)\nFrom the start of the word, `Ctrl-Shift-Right` to select the word. \nThen `Ctrl-X` to cut it.\n\nThe vi approach? `dw` deletes the word.\n\nHow about cutting five words with a `Ctrl-X` application?\nFrom the start of the words:\n\n    Ctrl-Shift-Right\n    Ctrl-Shift-Right\n    Ctrl-Shift-Right\n    Ctrl-Shift-Right\n    Ctrl-Shift-Right\n    Ctrl-X\n\nAnd with vi?\n\n    d5w\n\nThe vi approach is far more versatile and actually more intuitive: `X` and `V` are not obvious or memorable \"Cut\" and \"Paste\" commands, whereas `dw` to **d**elete a **w**ord, and `p` to **p**ut it back is perfectly straightforward. But `X` and `V` are what we all know, so whilst vi is clearly superior, it's unfamiliar. Ergo, it is considered unfriendly. On no other basis, pure familiarity makes a Windows-like interface seem friendly. And as we learned in problem #1, Linux is necessarily different to Windows. Inescapably, Linux always appears less \"user-friendly\" than Windows. \n\nTo avoid #5a problems, all you can really do is try and remember that \"user-friendly\" doesn't mean \"What I'm used to\": Try doing things your usual way, and if it doesn't work, try and work out what a total novice would do."}

In these 2 years there have been no problems with me doing this and many teachers knew that I was using it.\n\nJust this week however, I was accused of \"hacking\" again, when actually it was another kid who was just ddosing the network so he had an excuse not to do work. Before they found him however, I was investigated because of what I did 3 years ago and was told that if I did not hand over my laptop and usbs, they would call in the police.

I am definitely considering just asking to be disconnected from the network instead of changing operating systems since I can just use mobile data.\n\nEdit 3: A bit late, but better than never. The result of this ended up being me given a school laptop instead of allowing me to use mine while at school. Their logic in this was that if another incident were to happen with their system, I would not be less suspicious as I am using a locked down system. This is pretty annoying, but definatly not the worst thing to happen in the world and I am super fortunate that they didn't just suspend me for having crap on my USB.", "output": "Can't use Linux?

I'm running Ubuntu 24.04 on a Lenovo ThinkPad and have had zero issues this whole time. It was easy to set up, I got all the programs I wanted, did some minor cosmetic adjustments, and its been smooth sailing since.\n\nI was just curious why, when I go on these forums and people ask which distro to use when starting people almost never say Ubuntu? It's almost 100% Mint or some Ubuntu variant but never Ubuntu itself. The most common issue I see cited is snaps, but is that it? Like, no one's forcing you to use snaps.\n\nEDIT: Wow! I posted this and went to bed. I thought I would get like 2 responses and woke up to over 200! Thanks for all the answers, I think I have a better picture of what's going on. Clearly people feel very strongly about this!", "output": "Honestly, Ubuntu has just gone in a direction over the years that turns a lot of Linux users off. The whole Snap thing is just the tip of the iceberg. Sure, no one's forcing you to use Snaps – but Canonical is pushing them hard. Some applications are only available as Snaps now, they start slower, don't integrate well with the system, and just feel... wrong compared to native packages.\n\nOn top of that, Canonical keeps making decisions that feel completely disconnected from the community. Unity, Mir, Upstart, now Snap – all these were things they tried to push through, only to eventually abandon them. It makes the whole project feel inconsistent. And let's not forget the telemetry they tried to sneak in – even though it's toned down now, that left a bad taste for many users.\n\nUbuntu increasingly feels like a product, not a free and open system. It's obvious Canonical wants to make money – which is fine – but it comes at the expense of community trust. Distros like Fedora or even Linux Mint just feel more transparent, honest, and user-focused.\n\nAnother issue: packages in Ubuntu's official repos are often outdated. If you want up-to-date software, you have to rely on PPAs or Flatpaks, which fragments the system even more. At that point, I might as well use Arch or Manjaro and have it all out of the box.\n\nI'm not saying Ubuntu is bad – it's fine for beginners. But once you want to dig a little deeper, you quickly realize how rigid and bloated it can be. No wonder people tend to recommend Mint, Fedora, or Arch instead."}

(I only used Ubuntu on a surface level before.)", "output": "There are three main reasons it started getting a lot of hate.\n\n1. Snaps.  This whole thread is full of people elaborating on this.  In summary, they don't align with FOSS ideology and it triggers the community from a software design ethics standpoint.  From an end user standpoint, they aren't usually a huge deal.  Snaps have been known to run a little slower than native installs, plus they run in a somewhat \"quarantined\" environment that limits what the apps can access on your system.  In practice (at least in my experience) this can result in, for example, the Firefox Snap not being able to download files directly to a secondary hard drive.  That leads to the second reason people are outraged by Ubuntu's implementation of Snaps; Firefox is actually \"forced\" into a Snap install on Ubuntu.  One used to be able to uninstall the Firefox Snap and use \"apt install firefox\" to use a native install, until Ubuntu actually made that a shortcut to install the Snap anyway.  This took away user choice, and no one has trusted Ubuntu with Snaps ever since.\n2. GNOME 3.  When GNOME completely changed its interface between version 2 to the more macOS-like interface of GNOME 3, a lot of people really hated it.  It's pretty easy to just use a different DE, but since Ubuntu by default prefers GNOME 3 it was a divisive change.\n3. Telemetry.  Linux users hate Windows for having telemetry that it reports back to Microsoft about your personal system information.  Ubuntu added telemetry with an easy opt-out option, and a lot of people never forgave them for it.\n\nI personally left Ubuntu when the latest version update killed AppArmor, which also killed Snaps since they inherently rely on it.  It was just enough of an inconvenience to push me away from Ubuntu's promotion of Snaps, but I'm also not in the group that would deter anyone from using Ubuntu just because Snaps.  For the most part, my Ubuntu install was one of the most stable I've had until the borked version update.

It is pretty much a fresh install with just my files and Tbird/Firefox configured.\n* My addons should block all 3rd party scripts (notably NoScript and Ublock Origin, but others also). I've checked and there are no scripts running on the page I had open ([invideo.us](https://invideo.us)) according to NoScript\n* I'm pretty sure that the iso is legit since it is downloaded from the official torrent with multiple seeders - I'll check the sha56sum tonight. I'll also check the proton cli downloaded from the proton vpn site.\n* Significantly all the actions are focused in the top right hand of the screen (incognito, open/close windows, bookmarked google doc in toolbar, google login, reddit inbox). \n* Kde shortcut exists on trackpad allowing copy-pasting to notes (and clipboard) via the trackpad\n* Seemingly random nature of material copy-pasted.\n* Laptop sitting on woollen cushion with my metal spectacles placed close to trackpad (static?). \n* No anomalies in the log files I've looked at so far\n* I'm a pretty boring person and unlikely to be the target of nation states or sophisticated hackers\n\nI am starting to think (hope) that trackpad was buggy, perhaps related to spectacles and static, and that the cursor somehow drifted to the upper right of the screen and started hammering on links and functions in that area, by chance doing something rather surprising (e.g. creating sticky note and pasting into it!).\n\n&#x200B;", "output": "I would not incriminate XSS given the fact he interacted with your whole application/desktop, meaning he managed to break the sandbox.\n\nWhen you're able to escape a sandbox, you don't hack random dudes on the internet ;)"}

This is something you should do overtime.

Ask them to make a note of this over time. Since it's common for people to have software they don't know or remember.\n\nSecond, migrate to new software using the windows version of that software. For example if they use Microsoft office, ask them to try OnlyOffice. Getting them on software that is cross platform before the switch will improve the transition. But also allows them to fallback to their old software if there's a problem.\n\nOnce you feel confident that replacements exist for all of your business functions, you can start the roll over. Try to find employees who have good replacements and are ideally excited about the operating system and experimentation. Have something 2 of them make the switch. They can gain experience of resolving any issues and using the software and/or hardware.\n\nIf they've successfully switched, then you can bring more on board, like another 2. Again, building your team's knowledge overtime, slowly.\n\nMost likely you'll get to a point where 7-8 on onboard but a few left who are using specific software that doesn't have good alternatives.  You can decide then how you might want to proceed, most likely you'll need some type of mixed system for awhile, or have dedicated windows machines for specific functions.\n\nAlso, consider supporting a company like System76 if your existing machines have support issues. They have some pretty cheap workstations which come with Linux preinstalled.\n\nThe basic idea is being knowledgeable about what you're using, who's going to be difficult to transition and who will be easy. Who's excited about a change like this and who isn't. Consider the comfort level for your employees. Have multiple steps which are good exit or delay points for troubleshooting."}

If a critical library like glibc gets updated and then you abort the update, most programs just outright stop working and you are left with no option but to manually perform a very advanced recovery from a live cd.\n\nDon't run random commands from the internet if you don't know what they are going to do. It is not hard to conceal a harmful command or to create a command that looks harmless but isn't.\n\nBe careful when typing commands. When explaining to my friend how to clear the cache for his user on Linux, I told him to run `rm -r ~/.cache`. Instead, he ran `rm -r ~/ .cache`. Notice the difference? There is a space between `~/` and `.cache`. To an inexperienced user, that may seem insignificant, but the first command says to delete the `.cache` folder within the home directory, while the second says to delete the home directory _and_ the `.cache` folder in the _current_ directory. This caused him to lose all his user's files.\n\nIf a command fails with `Permission Denied` and you don't know what it does, don't just run it with `sudo`. While it may be harmless, root privileges literally allow you to do _anything_, which means whenever you run something with `sudo`, it has access to your entire system and even your hardware in many cases, so be careful when running commands as root."}
{"id": "qwy64u", "instruction": "Sad state of hardware accelerated video on linux browser", "input": "At present, a user has only two options for a reasonable browser as firefox and chromium. All other browsers are either derivatives of above, or simply unsuitable for modern use (couple of webkit based mayb be usable but I have little idea how to enable hardware acceleration on them). So i will detail the steps required to enable browser hardware accelerated video on both and how there are compromises in either. My graphics card is amd 260x with open source amdgpu driver. CPU is i7 2600k.\n\nBefore starting, let me answer why a user would prefer to enable hardware acceleration in first place:\n\n1. Improve battery life in portable devices\n2. Save CPU resources for other tasks\n3. Prevent excess fan noise / cpu heating\n\n# Firefox\n\nFirefox currently supports hardware acceleration on both x11 and wayland. I tested on firefox 96 (nightly) to give best shot possible. So the following settings need to be changed in `about:config`:\n\n    media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled\ttrue\n    gfx.webrender.all\t        true\n    media.ffvpx.enabled             false\n\nIn addition, while running X11, firefox should be launched with variable `MOZ_X11_EGL=1` . Also, users should ensure that vaapi is available by installing/running `vainfo` in terminal. In cases where gpu only supports h.264 decode, its beneficial to install [h.264ify](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/h264ify/).\n\nWhat works:\n\n1. both 30fps/60fps or higher videos play smoothly at resolutions supported by gpu decoder.\n2. CPU usage is significantly reduced while playing videos\n\nThe problems:\n\n1. The colour of videos appears washed out. (0,0,0) is mapped to (16,16,16) and (255,255,255) to (235,235,235). [Bug 1726186](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1726186). Edit - bug was fixed in version 96\n2. Nvidia users out of luck (for now)\n\n# Chromium\n\nChromium also supports hardware acceleration in x11 and wayland. This too was tested in chromium-dev 97. To enable it, first set `chrome://flags/#ignore-gpu-blocklist` to `disabled`. Then launch chromium with following flags:\n\n    --use-gl=desktop --enable-features=VaapiVideoDecoder\n\nIn theory, `--use-gl=desktop` should not be required in wayland, but I couldn't get it to work without it. Also h.264ify will be required as stated above.\n\nWhat works:\n\n1. both 30fps/60fps or higher videos play smoothly at resolutions supported by gpu decoder, unless vulkan backend is enabled through flags. However there is little reason to enable it for now\n2. Videos are played colour accurately\n\nThe problems:\n\n1. CPU usage reduction is minimal. I could not observe significant improvement in reduction of cpu load or improved battery life ( on different machine) despite confirming that hardware video acceleration was working while playing videos\n2. Nvidia users out of luck again\n\n# Epiphany/Gnome Web\n\nBased on GTKwebkit, it provides another option for users that may be not as powerful as chrome or firefox, but still fairly usable for modern web. To enable hardware accelerated video, first install `gstreamer-vaapi` for amd/intel gpus or `gst-plugins-bad` and `nvidia-utils` for nvidia GPUs. Then run:\n\n    gsettings set org.gnome.Epiphany.web:/ hardware-acceleration-policy 'always'\n\nWhat works:\n\n1. both 30fps/60fps or higher videos play smoothly at resolutions supported by gpu decoder\n2. Videos are colour accurate\n3. Works for nvidia users\n4. Good reduction in CPU usage\n\nThe problems:\n\n1. Lack of extensions\n2. No simple way to limit video codec to h.264, hence older GPUs will lack hardware video acceleration in most videos with codecs other than h.264\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nCompared to windows, where hardware video acceleration is enabled by default in most hardware, the same needs to be set up in linux and compromises needed to be made. I find little reason to enable hardware video acceleration in chrome, since it fails to do the single most important function of saving cpu resources. In case of firefox, there is some benefit, but one has to bear with washed out, dull videos.\n\nThe best method currently to enjoy online videos is setting to launch either VLC or MPV when video is played in any of these browsers. It will lower CPU utilization greater than firefox, and videos will be colour accurate. However thanks to DRM streaming services and custom video players that are abundant online, this approach is applicable only to some websites.\n\nIn case some users are aware about workarounds, do post in comments.\n\nEdit: many commenters claim that the bug mentioned above for firefox does not affect them. I couldn't find anything different in configs, so it may be related to some specific hardware. In that case, firefox may currently be the best browser on linux for playing online videos\n\nEdit2: Added Gnome web/Epiphany on advice of u/rayi512x\n\n**Edit 3:** [**Bug 1726186**](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1726186) **in firefox has been resolved in version 96.

This provides excellent performance and provides a very smooth presentation to the user with minimal resource requirements (no need to send data between different binaries, ect)\n\nX11 (Most popular implementation is Xorg) is an old protocol that was originally designed for running on a PC the size of a room and sending display data over a slow network to a remote terminal back in the 80s. Because of the small initial scope of X11, it was never designed with the idea of a local connection or multiple monitors at different resolutions with different refresh rates. Because of this, extensions were required to allow users to gain those functionalities (xrandr and xinerama).\n\nNowadays a typical setup for Xorg looks like the following: An X11 display server, An X11 window manager running as a client (same as firefox or any other app would) and an X11 compositor. All of these components have to communicate to each other though IPC (IPC is not designed for graphic usage) and X11 (keep in mind X11 is a protocol designed for remote NETWORK usage) so because of this there are many performance limitations. So because everything is separated into different running binaries, to do very simple small things will require all 3 of these binaries to communicate to each other very frequently using very ill suited/old methods thus causes poor performance.\n\nThere is also the side note of security. By design, all Wayland clients CANNOT see each other or have access to the input devices (keyboard, mouse) without having focus on it. X11 on the other hand does not have such limitations, allowing applications to snoop on your activities regardless of if they're in focus or not. A by product of this is poor keybind support for applications, as they cannot see your inputs without being focused."}

Mostly everybody pointed at a job/scheduler thing - so when I was digging through /tmp a file named  scheduler.log stood out. crawling through through it I found references to a zyxel utility (`/usr/bin/zydbcli`). Called it and got a help screen. Then called `/usr/bin/zydbcli --queryschall`   \nand low and behold, there was a job in there to reboot the nas every first Tuesday of the month at 8:00 am. Which fiit the bill, since it went into a boot loop yesterday. Removed that using the same utility, and the boot loop has stopped, effectively resolving the issue.

Every year, in December, my small linux box goes into a continous boot loop. Sometime after New Year it will start working normally like nothing ever happenned.\n\nOk, now let me give you a little background. I'm a developer, so I have a technical background but sysadmin stuff is not my strong suit. This is a Zyxel NSA320 NAS which, after installing some package from its interface is now also running some minimalistic linux. I get command line access (ssh) and have transmission and minidlna running on it - nothing more. It's basically a torrentbox/mediacenter.\n\nWhat I found is that it is actually accessible via ssh for a few seconds before rebooting. 5-10 seconds at most. So I could potentially run predefined command or script on it and get its output.\n\nFirst time it happenned, I almost wrote it off as broken until it just started working again. This is now the 4th year it's doing this - and I figured why not, this is an odd enough thing, somebody might actually enjoy troubleshooting this (I know I will).I've tried the usual poweroff, completely unplug, even disconnected from the network entirely, re-seated the HDD inside (out of desperation).

Every Unix worked that way, MacOS too. Until Microsoft decided it was a good idea to let the hardware manufacturer write the drivers themselves and provided APIs in MS DOS and windows for this.\n\nThis is in fact a horrible idea, since you essentially give away control over essential parts of the OS to an unknown third party. Malicious drivers have been a security problem in windows ever since, even though MS tried to fix it with the requirement of signed drivers.\n\nIn Linux, hardware drivers are mostly part of the kernel.

I tried to make it as short as possible, while giving all the needed details. If you happen to know any info, even about one of those distros or my questions, please comment! CHeers :)", "output": "First off, huge thanks for doing your own research and writing up such a detailed post! This helps a lot to pick out a suitable distro for you.\n\nA friendly and large community naturally is Ubuntu's kind of thing, so you might want to look towards that direction.\n\n\n Stability means you definitely want to look over to the point release distros, so let's say Ubuntu, Ubuntu based distros like Linux Mint. A point release distro usually makes a big release around every 6 months, and a \"rolling\" release distro will constantly release new, up to date packages. Point release results in better stability and a \"just works\" experience, while rolling release is in general less stable, but also gets the latest and newest things which may or may not break.\n\n\nThe ability to configure GUI depends on the desktop environment, not distro. I'd point you towards the KDE Plasma desktop environment, but I see you have an Nvidia card. Nvidia cards aren't really known to work the best with Linux, and KDE Plasma is probably the biggest example of this kind of thing. The animations lag, the desktop environment feels sluggish, you name it. One moment it feels butter smooth, and the next it grinds down to a halt and makes you feel like you're on a 2005 PC with how slow it can appear. You can definitely still try it though, your mileage may vary, as I hear people having no issues with it. I personally really enjoy GNOME (the desktop environment that looks \"alien\" to you), but I must say that it's customizability isn't all that impressive. If you do want to try GNOME sometime, keep in mind that it's a keyboard focused desktop environment. You can definitely comfortably use it with a mouse, though. So for you, you might want to look into desktop environments like XFCE(lightweight DE, doesn't look the flashiest, but it can definitely be made to look quite modern and sleek with some customizations.) or Cinnamon(developed by the Linux Mint team, praised for how intuitive it is for transitioning Windows users). As for your dark theme, pretty much any desktop environment has support for that.\n\n\nNow for your current distro choices:\n\n\nZorin could be nice. But really, I think there are better options, it doesn't seem to do anything better than other distros..\n\n\n\nLinux Mint is a phenomenal choice for new Linux users. All your upsides are pretty much spot on. The dated looks can always be changed with a theme, and as for the user friendliness, I don't agree. It's based on Ubuntu which naturally is the most supported and documented distro. It seems to tick almost all of your boxes, I personally love this distro. Has the best support for Cinnamon, since it's developed by the very same team. \n\n\n\n\nFeren, I don't hear much about it, can't give a solid opinion.\n\n\n\nPOP_OS is another amazing distro for newcomers. It's Ubuntu based just like Mint, so it has the same user friendliness upsides. As for the alien interface, I can share some thoughts on that. When I came from Windows, I absolutely despised GNOME. Now, it's my favorite desktop environment just because it looks so sleek and simply works well with my Nvidia setup. GNOME has modifications called extensions which you can easily get off the internet with a browser extension. Those modifications include a Dash to Dock reminiscent of MacOS, a panel mode extension(essentially converts GNOME to a Windows-like interface), and for example the current weather on your top bar. Definitely worth a look! If it means anything, Pop OS by far has the best Nvidia support right out of the box.\n\n\n\nAll your choices are pretty much good. I personally believe the best 3 distros for newcomers are Ubuntu(a lot of hate it gets is stuck in the past, none of the past controversies will affect your experience), Linux Mint and Pop OS. You literally can't go wrong with any of those 3. :)"}

{"id": "1k2ynao", "instruction": "What are some things on Windows that are missing on Linux?", "input": "Aside from Bloatware and Spyware, you're not clever.", "output": "These are very technical and opinionated topics so I expect to get downvoted.\n\n- Docker Desktop for Windows is miles  better than Docker CE on Linux when it comes to buildx support and dealing with insecure repositories and cross platform builds. I still struggle with setting up buildx builders for cross platform builders to this day despite having over 7 years of experience with Docker. Good luck explaining why you'd ever use cross platform builders with buildx to a coworker and how to set them up especially with insecure repositories (all of this just works on Windows).\n\n- In some ways Windows generally has a better driver model than Linux. The Windows Minifilter Driver is more robust (and is freuqnetly the basis for anticheat) than anything on Linux. Linux doesn't have a direct equivalent with modules as it keeps the file system hooks as part of its LSM architecture which is not exported so can't be used by kernel modules.\n\n- Microsoft does proprietary software better. The Linux Kernel team for example is openly hostile towards closed sources and proprietary kernel modules, and the people who maintain projects like glibc are openly hostile to people statically linking against them because it violates the GPL and specifically Stallman's hacker culture (interoperability) beliefs.\n\n- There are some very niche pieces of software like the Windows Phone integration that are miles better than the Linux equivalents (KDE Connect) and allow you to do things like pick up your phone and take calls through the operating system. AFAIK you cannot do this on Linux (you CAN do Text Messages however).\n\n- In many cases there is just one way to do something on windows (e.g. notifications) so there's no beurocracy over whether or not a desktop notification daemon is responsible for doing something like playing audio when a notification is received (This was written for you GNOME maintainers).\n\n- Interoperability when it comes to being able to use the alternative OS. Right now only Windows containers can be run on Windows but Linux containers can be run on both Windows and Linux. This matters if you don't want to deploy Windows VMs and want to build cross platform for Linux and Windows like I have to because of my job. (Visual Studio is very bad with Wine and some thing like nmake fundamentally don't work). It doesn't help that Windows containers are implemented through Hyper-V VMs afaik. (Why can't we have an equivalent that leverages qemu + kvm?)\n\n- The Windows API is generally very stable (much more stable than Linux's). Today you can still write software that is backwards compatible with systems from 25 years ago. Supporting Windows XP is actually trivial in 2025 if you target the right Visual Studio SDK while still getting access to a modern compiler + ABI. For Linux it's a challenge to support something as old as CentOS 7 because the Glibc ABI is constantly changing and \"universal binaries\" with modern toolkits are a challenge here.\n\n- However there's a big con with the above. Modern systems programming languages like go and rust do not support Windows XP so its almost always favorable to write legacy programs (even new software development) in C or C++ if you need to support Windows XP (Something I need to do).\n\n- I don't think that Linux has any easy equivalent to managed GPO, especially remote management and control.\n\nI can probably think of some more, but I think I'm going to get downvoted as it is.\n\nEdit: This thread made me realize I know a lot more about corporate IT than your average redditor but when it comes to corporate IT there are many \"linux\" equivalents, but not really any of them are as user friendly as you'd get with a Windows Server stack.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for all of the constructive discussion, it's rare to see a thread this lively and not toxic in the reddit linux community. I usually am pretty toxic with the amount of \"what distro should I use\" threads, and this gave me a lot of faith in reddit as a whole."}

{"id": "kr8y6r", "instruction": "What changes did you not expect to happen from switching to Linux?", "input": "TL; DR - My desktop went from a disgusting mess to completely empty.\n\nI switched from using only Windows my whole life to Linux full-time about a year ago, and a big change for me was using a file structure that actually made sense. Basically, I'd spent all of my years participating in the disgusting practice of: 1) Accumulate a bunch of files on your desktop. 2) When your desktop becomes too full, create a New Folder, and throw it all in there. 3) Repeat until you have half a dozen New Folders on your desktop. 4) Create one more New Folder, put all the others inside that. 5) Repeat.\n\nThe biggest reason for that was probably just that the file structures didn't make much sense to me on Windows. Yeah, if you opened the file manager, there were Pictures, Videos, etc. on the left, but trying to figure out what was actually going on was weird to me. Had to go to the top level where Program Files and what not were, then Users, then choose my account out of a handful of other options that were there despite me being the only user, then you find the Desktop, Documents, etc., along with a bunch of other folders and files I'd never seen before. Why bother with all that when I can just stay comfy on the Desktop and Downloads folders?\n\nSwitching to Linux, I took the time to actually learn the file structures and why most of the directories were there, on root and user levels, and things made sense to me. Like, it makes sense that `/home/kavb333/` is my user's home directory, where my Desktop, Documents, etc. are, and it makes sense that my .config, .cache, etc. would be there, too. Of course the high level user stuff is just at `~/<here>` because that's the home directory. So after I made the switch, I took a day or two out of my time to go through the disgusting war crime I committed over the years to my desktop, and put things into the directories they actually belong, and now my Desktop is almost always empty.", "output": "Yes! The file structure on linux feels way more natural, perhaps i just didn't spend enough time learning windows's file structure...\n\nGreat to hear that you're happy using linux!"}

When it finally did load, it ran horribly. \n\n I tried to rollback before the updates but the OS is running so shitty, I can even get to the settings to see if there's a rollback available. \n\nSo now I'm like, fuck it. Let's give Linux a try. I tried years ago, but I had issues finding a distro  that let me do pinch and zoom with my trackpad. Now I don't care about that anymore. I need a working laptop with an OS that doesn't terrify me everytime there's an update. I blocked Windows updates for almost 2 years because it fucked up my computer last time. This time is even worse. \n\n\nI'm not a computer expert but I can read and follow directions pretty well. I've done things like install custom ROMs on my phones without bricking them. A lil effort to get my tech to work won't scare me. Though I prefer something that's simple to use for newbies.

During the conversation, this exchange took place:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> I don't wanna wear out the battery by plugging it in. \n\nAh, okay, now I get it. I hate to tell you this, but here are the facts of battery life:\n\n* Not plugging in your laptop except to recharge the battery **wears out your battery**.\n\n* But plugging in your laptop -- leaving your laptop plugged in most of the time -- **does not wear out your battery**. \n\nAn intelligent laptop battery charger only charges the battery to about 80% *in the long term* (depending on the battery type), then maintains that charge level, neither adding to nor subtracting from the charge level. In the short term the charger provide 100% charge, but over a longer period, this charge level is allowed to decline.\n\nWhen the laptop is plugged in, when it's in use, *all the power comes from the charger, not the battery*. So the battery, neither being charged nor discharged, has a very long life.\n\nIf the laptop is not plugged in when in use, the battery must provide all the operating power, and that power must be replaced periodically. This means the battery is constantly being charged and discharged, *which substantially shortens the battery's life.*\n\nA battery's service lifetime is measured by how many charge/discharge cycles it can tolerate. *If you want to wear out your battery, by all means force it to charge and discharge every day.* The best way to destroy your laptop's battery is to use it without line power, then plug it in and force a recharge, every day.\n\nIf you do this, the computer manufacturers will love you, because you'll be replacing your laptops like clockwork, especially now that new-laptop batteries can't even be accessed/removed/replaced any more.\n\nADDENDUM: This is true for electric cars also:\n\n[Electric car battery life: how to preserve your battery](https://www.drivingelectric.com/your-questions-answered/96/electric-car-battery-life-how-preserve-your-battery) : \"A battery expert on a Tesla forum (with a PhD in electromechanical engineering) recommends keeping your state of charge between 15% and 90%, others 25%-75%, but advice varies. Some say 20%-80%, but fundamentally, the rule is don’t overcharge it or let it go completely flat.\"\n\nOne may ask what relevance electric car batteries have for laptop batteries.

Linux can.  With Linux, updates can occur in the background while you work on other things.  You can postpone a reboot indefinitely with Linux.  \nWindows, otoh, can't modify those files so they have to be stored somewhere and then be applied on the next reboot.   This takes time while the user waits.\n\nAlso, Windows is more complicated due to how it evolved.  I won't get into details, but there are a lot of hard dependencies between components and internal binary data stores.  Linux is much simpler.\n\nThese 2 things combined are worse then their sum.  The complexity of Windows sometimes requires multiple reboots to fully apply an update.  Plus, since Windows 10, Microsoft has been much more aggressive with pushing updates.  It used to be that you could wait until you were ready, but not if you wait too long, you get an update if you like it or not.\n\nI have generalized some statements above and someone being pedantic could nit-pick what I've written, but in general, this is the problem at a high level."}

I just work in game engines and write gameplay related scripts, and just play games in my free time etc. So i haven't found a reason for a person like me to switch over.

Good luck, it's apparently \"required to install stuff\". Why ? Why are there two control panels ? \n\nThen there's the security, and the reliability. It just works. None of these spectacularly destructive failures, especially on updates. You can change things easily. Stuff is documented. You get the impression the people who wrote these things know how it works, whereas Microsoft is chaotic (read the book \"Showstoppers\", a history of Windows NT). It's quicker, there's no Windows rot.\n\nThe granular design. Windows is still a huge lump of stuff, which is why updates are so shambolic. Linux is compartmentalised, library x does one thing or closely related set of things. SDL does game graphics/sound/controllers. You update that, you don't update anything else. None of these composite \"patches\". The chaotic design is why there are so many update fails. Apple avoid it with the other scam, forced upgrades of software and hardware. \n\nThe only reason Windows gets away with it is most of its users don't do anything much with it ; they browse the web, read emails, maybe watch videos, maybe play a few games.\n\nFinally the dumping. You a Silverlight user ? Remember when Microsoft wanted all web apps to be VB Controls in an ActiveX wrapper. Probably you don't. \n\nBut Microsoft will happily sh\\*t on customers for benefit. Sometimes it's just sheer nastiness, like I recall IE lost the ability to do scalable vector graphics, which presumably was pushing Silverlight or something. I still have nightmares about trying to get a sound sample to play consistently across browsers. Chrome, Firefox, Opera, no problem. XXXXing Internet Explorer and XXXXing Safari, Microsoft and Apple, lock-in and monetise our speciality, nightmare. Do we support OGG ?, no because we want our format to be the only one so we can license it.\n\nThe only reason to stay with Windows is if you are a high level gamer (currently, restrictions on game cheating) or you have an app that won't work virtualised that you need on enough not to dual boot, or some piece of hardware that doesn't work (sometimes you have to go the other way, for older hardware that you can't get modern drivers for).\n\nIt will get worse.

{"id": "gyt88d", "instruction": "Snaps: why are they so controversial and how do they affect performance?", "input": "Hello,\n\nThis is not at all meant to start a flame war, I’m genuinely wanting to learn here. I’ve seen a number of people mentioning how much they hate Snaps and Snap support - even going so far as to considering leaving distros that support them by default. As a non-advanced user, I’ve found them helpful for certain things. For a media server, they sandbox the files and automatically stay updated. I’m wanting to learn and understand why they are negative.\n\nSecondly, I’m curious about the performance of something installed via a Snap. Again, for a media server, I’ve found that running in Docker can negatively affect ability to transcode and access all threads/core of the processor. I’m curious if running via a Snap also eats up more resources and affects performance since all the files needed are installed in the Snap (even if they are already installed outside of it). I’m wondering if this similarly affects things like transcoding performance, etc as well. \n\nAny info would be incredibly helpful. I’m trying to learn and understand about Snaps and also figure out why I’m seeing some spikes in CPU usage from a Snap install. Thanks so much in advance!", "output": "Snaps follow the pattern of other recent packaging technologies like Appimages and Flatpaks -- these try to break the dependency logjam that has gotten worse over the years. As Linux becomes more complex, a given application's chance to run without coming into conflict with another application's libraries and dependency requirements declines. This leads to something called \"dependency hell\", where it's impossible to launch and run an application without interfering with another application.\n\nSnaps and the others address this issue by packaging all dependencies together with the application in an isolation container, segregating it from the rest of the system. The drawback is that such a package is much larger than an equivalent conventional application that happens not to conflict with any others. Such a container takes up more storage space, takes longer to launch, and in some cases has a peculiar set of interface requirements.\n\nSnaps take this a step further by having a very strict security model that in some cases prevents the isolated application from being able to read the data files it must, or in other cases prevents the application from functioning at all.\n\nClementine is a media player that tends to be difficult to install because of its many dependencies. So it's now a Snap. One minor problem -- Clementine cannot read the media files it must, in order to be of any use. Why? The Snap security model.\n\nMany organizations want to move their /home directory out of the system root  for various reasons -- some businesses prefer this because it allows them to use \"thin clients\" wired to a central data server that holds all the organization's data. One problem, though -- they cannot do this with Snaps, which won't function if the /home directory is remoted in certain common ways. So either no business users, or no Snaps, and there is no third option.\n\nCanonical is pushing Snaps pretty hard right now, for reasons of their own. Their fervor is such that when a Ubuntu 20.04 user tries to install the Chromium browser, the Apt profile for Chromium merely triggers a switch that tries to install the Snap version of Chromium. The user is given a stark choice -- install the Snap or do without Chromium.\n\nThis wrenching of control out of the hands of users rubs a lot of people the wrong way and is causing much discussion about what this augurs for the future of Linux, a future that seems to be drifting away from individual choice toward corporate control over end users.\n\nThese and related issues has caused the Linux Mint developers to [remove the Snap system from their offering](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-mint-dumps-ubuntu-snap/).\n\nThat's the controversy, in a nutshell."}

If you've got a \"regular\" user account sudo is most likely enabled by default.\n   * With that I mean you don't want to set a separate root password but use sudo to elevate instead.\n* If you've got SSH enabled, only use public key authentication.\n   * Additional SSH hardening [here](https://www.sshaudit.com/hardening_guides.html)\n* If possible and feasible, use a [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/) or similar\n* You can use something like [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net/) and add blocklists for malicious hosts. (that requires some more setup though.) \n   * Alternatively you can use your own-built setup with dnsmasq and some custom lists (which is basically what PiHole is).\n* If you've got a modern enough system: use EFI and EFI's [SecureBoot](https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot) feature \n* In your web browser the following extensions can provide additional protection:\n   * ~~Ghostery~~ (**caution** see [u/ConfidentVegetable81's](https://www.reddit.com/user/ConfidentVegetable81/) response below regarding Ghostery)\n   * NoScript\n   * HTTPS Everywhere\n   * uBlock Origin\n   * EFF Privacy Badger\n   * Containerized tabs\n   * uMatrix\n   * Decentraleyes\n* Some additional [FireFox hardening](https://restoreprivacy.com/firefox-privacy/) \n\n\n\nKeep in mind the list below is pretty advanced, and you shouldn't just go tinkering with it unless you have a decent understanding of what you're doing:\n\n* Most linux distro's these days utilise Systemd. You can use systemd's functionality to greatly reduce the permissions a service can use.\n   * [https://github.com/alegrey91/systemd-service-hardening](https://github.com/alegrey91/systemd-service-hardening) \n* Disable unneeded kernel modules\n   * You don't need things like SCTP, DCCP, NFS, etc. on a regular desktop.\n* Enable and configure AppArmor or SELinux\n* Make sure at least /boot and /tmp are on separate partitions and set the `nosuid`, `noexec` and `nodev` flags\n* Look into sandboxing - firejail is popular but has some downsides when it comes to vulnerabilities.

For me I usually just say linux but I use GNU/Linux when the distinction to non-gnu distros is important.\n\nBut there are a few things on your post that might need some clarifying...\n\n>So GNU is built on top of Linux no?\n\nYes and no. Historically it's a clear no...gnu is much older than the linux kernel and the linux kernel was specifically written to run gnu's glibc, bash and gcc on it. Also important to mention that the linux kernel isn't the only kernel GNU software runs on...actually I am not sure if there are any \"major\" kernels gnu doesn't run on ;). But technically of course true, the kernel is lower level than the GNU userspace.\n\n>Considering GNU is not even essential to have a working linux distribution.\n\nAgain...true to some extent but also misleading a bit. It is true that GNU is not necessray for a linux distribution...but it is also true that without the GNU userspace or an alternative you can't make a linux distro either. Every program on your system needs a libc..in the case of GNU distros that is glibc. And more than that...the libc is also responsible for dynamic loading libraries ( through /lib/ld-linux.so.2 to be precise). So without a userspace like GNU a computer only running the linux kernel would be pretty much a brick on your desk..it can't do anything at all.\n\nThat is what makes GNU so special...it's not like systemd (what people seem to love to throw in these discussion) which is almost completely irrelevant to a working system. There are probably a handful of applications that really need systemd to run...in comparison to every single binary on your system needing a libc (be that glibc or any of the alternatives). \n\nAlso important to understand that for programs the GNU userspace interface (or alternatives) is usually more important than the kernel itself. Not many programs talk directly to the kernel, most go through the libc layer. Which brings us back to the \"Considering GNU is not even essential\"..the exactly same can be said about the linux kernel. We have an example of this right now in use by lots of people..Microsofts WSL1. Basically Microsoft wrote a linux kernel replacement that can run an unmodified glibc and because of that many linux programs without any modifications. You install an existing linux distro on it...only without the linux kernel. No changes to the distro needed..the precompiled binaries just work. And that is mostly thanks to GNU userspace (or again..any alternatives here..it's not important that it is gnu..it is important that it exists in the first place).\n\nThen to the point where using GNU/Linux is actually really meaningful...binary compatibility. As said above..every program on your system goes through the libc. Yes, there are plenty of alternatives to GNU's glibc out there like ulibc or musl. But those libraries are not binary compatible...ony API compatible. Meaning you can usually compile the same sourcecode and it works on both...but you can not take the binary compiled for one and run it on the other. So...now we have things like the propritary nvidia drivers or steam for which we have no access to the sourcecode...we can not recompile them to any other libc. We are stuck to the libc the companies used when creating their binaries...and that is glibc. Only GNU/linux systems can run steam or use the nvidia drivers...distro's using alternative userspaces like alpine linux can not (at least not without installing almost a complete distro minus the kernel in parallel that is based on glibc). So for binary program compatibility mentioning it runs on GNU/linux is essential."}

I probably don't need to explain how shady/annoying Norton is here... If you know, you know.\n\nBut while my mom admits Norton is really shady at times, she'd never use a computer without an AV. The thought of having no antivirus on my new laptop (or even using something like ClamAV) really rubs her the wrong way, and now she's suspicious of Linux as a whole. She's doubtful that there'd be a free OS that didn't sell your information or do anything behind your back; to her, nothing is ever so simple.\n\nI know that no system is 100% safe, but I've heard that Linux is not as vulnerable to malware in general compared to Windows. So finally, here's my question: How do I convince her beyond a shadow of a doubt that Linux is just as safe as Windows virus-wise?\n\nI'm sorry if this is a dumb question.

It's one of the most widely used operating systems (by some counts the most widely used, including internet servers) for a reason. The open source nature of Linux means that many of the world's best programmers have contributed their expertise to its code base. And, it is open source, meaning anyone can review the source code for themselves. What would you trust more, code that is review able by anyone? Or proprietary software that you're not allowed to see the inner workings of? \n\nThe fact that the software is free as in free beer is an amazing fact that still boggles my mind. It's a result of the combination of smart licensing, innovative legal thinking (for the creation and adopting of those licensing strategies), and a commitment by the community to sharing knowledge and tools. \n\nLinux is one of the highlights of modern humanity to me, as are all open source software projects."}

{"id": "af6xa5", "instruction": "What's the reason that I can just update ubuntu without restarting my pc while Windows needs a restart and I can't do anything while it installs", "input": "", "output": "One of the major reasons is the difference how open files are handled in linux and windows. Some linux experiment:\n\n- Open a terminal and run `ping www.google.com > googleping.txt` (Command chosen because it gives a constant output)\n- Open a second terminal and run `tail -f googleping.txt`...this shows you the content of the googleping.txt file updated all the time by new ping lines\n- And now to the fun part...open a third terminal and run `rm googleping.txt`...we just deleted the file that the first shell writes to and the second shell reads from...and nothing happens. Both shells happily continue their work and you get the output still displayed and growing.\n\nIn linux a file only get removed if the last handle to the file stops existing. By deleting a file with `rm` you remove one of those handles...but if there are open programs still accessing the file they can..the file still exists as long as the handles of those programs are still valid. \n\nIn windows this is different (usually, this is simplified a bit). If something accesses a file the file gets locked and can't be deleted. This is what makes updates \"interesting\"..simple example, a program currently runs and has its icon files open to display them in the menu...so now the icon files can not really be updated as they are locked. To get around this you can do it in two stages...you write the update to the program somewhere temporary and in a second stage you overwrite the actual program with that temporary copy when you can be sure the program is not running. As there are several programs/processes running from a very early state of the OS the only \"sure\" way is doing those updates right before a shutdown or directly after a reboot...before the programs are started or after they are closed.\n\nIn Linux this is not necessary as files are not locked and you can overwrite them at any time. But this has it's own set of problems...as seen in the very first example the `tail -f` keeps on using the file...even if you would create a new file with the exact same name it wouldn't change to that new file. This means that you can do updates during a running system...but the programs currently running will not notice them at once. You still have to restart the programs...and it can be rather tricky as well to figure out what programs need a restart and to do so (Update to Xorg needs Xorg restarted meaning all graphical programs will loose the connection to Xorg...so basically you have to restart everything above the pure text interface in this case. For system services this can get even worse and the outcome being almost the same as a reboot.)\n\nOh..and then there is of course kernel updates. While there are some techniques to do kernel patches without a reboot there is no real way around rebooting for major kernel updates."}

Linux is what we call a Unix-like OS. Which means it is inspired by the original Unix operating system that was created by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson. There are plenty others OS in the Unix family that were also all inspired by the Unix operating system.\n\nI'm not quite sure but wasn't Unix a closed source operating system ? If yes, how could have all these OS be inspired by it if they don't know how it worked ? I'm thinking that maybe they are just inspired by the philosophy of Unix which was \"keep it simple\" and not by the code at all. Is it the only thing that links all those systems ? I'm reading contradictory sources. Was the original Unix code released at some point ?\n\nThank you.", "output": "You don't have to know a single line of code to create something in the spirit of the original. That's basically what the whole lawsuit of Oracle against Google over Java was about.\n\nOracle argued that Google violated their IP by creating something that has the same naming conventions, but different implementation. The courts ruled in favor of Google.\n\nLinux is basically the same. It uses the same principles, syntax, but none of the code of Unix.\n\nThere is an international standard, [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX), that defines how programs should be written to be compatible between different Unix(-like) OSes.\n\nThere is no mainstream Linux that really adheres closely to that standard. So Linux today is still similar to Unix, but not Unix at all. (BSD flavors on the other hand adhere to the standard. So if you still want Unix, that's where you have to go)\n\nBtw. The original Unix code has been [released](https://computerhistory.org/blog/the-earliest-unix-code-an-anniversary-source-code-release/)."}

Let's break down why SSH with public/private keys is still secure, even though you use a password initially.\n\nHere's the key distinction:\n\n* **Password**: Used to initially add your public key to the server's authorized\\_keys list. This is a one-time step during setup.\n* **Public/Private Key Pair**: Used for ongoing secure authentication after the initial setup.\n\nHere's the process:\n\n1. You generate a public/private key pair on your local machine.\n2. You **need** a password to add the **public key** (not the private key) to the authorized\\_keys file on the server. This is like giving your fingerprint (public key) to the server, but you need a password (temporary verification) to confirm your identity.\n3. Once added, the server trusts anyone who can prove they possess the corresponding **private key** (which you keep secret).\n\nSo, the password is only used for the initial setup and doesn't compromise the ongoing security of SSH key authentication. Even if someone steals the public key (which is harmless), they can't log in without your private key.\n\nHere's an analogy:\n\nImagine your house has a deadbolt lock (public key). You can give copies of the key (public key) to friends, but they also need a one-time code (password) to be buzzed in (add the key to the authorized list) for the first visit. After that, they can only enter with their physical key (private key).\n\nSo, SSH with public/private keys offers strong security because your private key remains confidential and is required for ongoing authentication."}

Linux filesystems are faster. Ext4 will easily outperform NTFS because it doesn't have all the hooks that slow the latter down. Windows devs actually recommend the practice of splitting your system drive because the NTFS partition Windows is running from has additional hooks which slow it down.\n\n2. Linux is lying. By default, Linux will tell you that a transfer is finished after the file is read into RAM, not when it's actually written, which is only really noticeable if you're writing to a really slow storage medium. This way, you can start working on the file much sooner, but if you want to detach the drive, you need to wait until it's actually written. If you press eject it should start this process and it won't tell you to that it's safe to remove until it actually is.

But why is such an implementation on GNU/Linux so far behind.", "output": "The Microsoft implementation *seems* to be a compiler made by intel and microsoft in collaboration; it takes the .apk file (basically the same as a .tar.bz2 or similar archive) and then compiles all the Android API Calls (like draw a window of 800x200 and spin up some processes)  into Windows 11 API Calls (which will perform the same task but will need to be translated to API Calls Windows can understand) so that they work NATIVELY on Windows.\n\nPeople keep saying stuff about Anbox but I call bullshit on that because, literally every person just says, \"There's anbox but I haven't been able to get it to work or haven't used it in 10 years\". Which means it's not there because I haven't seen a single working modern Anbox instance.\n\nPeople also say to use the Android Studio Android x86 Emulator (Basically a KVM VM) or to set up a Virtualbox VM of Android x86 (Not the official android open source x86 implementation but an unofficial build that boots in Virtualbox and that hasn't seen many updates).\n\nWe will probably just have to wait till more information is given away by Intel about how it works, they have literally said nothing about how the \"Intel Bridge Technology\" works on a deeper level which could be because it's not that complex though I doubt that.\n\nIt could probably be achieved by a bunch of Linux devs, same thing, translating all the Android API Calls to ones that Linux understands. But it's not been done yet. Heck, maybe if it converts the .apk's to .exe's (or more likely, .appx's which do not work on wine) you could run those apps in Wine although even Wine is such a strange beast. Even Anbox, if someone can get it working, is a strange beast requiring lots of complex configuration, not exactly the one-click install that Microsoft has demoed.\n\nTo me, the sad reality (this may be an unpopular opinion on this sub) is that Linux (and FOSS in general) is falling further behind other Desktop Operating Systems (and *SOME* propreitary software) in terms of features and application support. The FOSS Community is too underfunded to keep up with the propreitary giants.

{"id": "tf429k", "instruction": "Linux on Public PCs in the Library", "input": "I work in a medium-sized, urban library with 10 public computers available for use. Currently, they're running Windows 10 Home (and it should be Enterprise). We're waiting on some grant money to perform hardware and software updates on the public PCs, partly so that I can upgrade them to Enterprise.\n\nHowever, technically I'm not supposed to be doing anything. We had a fairly competent tech team run by the state [Edit: the state Library Commission], which was then absorbed into the state's IT department, who are now also responsible for the libraries. They are bad at it. They barely show up to do their jobs, and when they do they half-ass it or break six other things in the process. Thus it has fallen on me to do most of the technical heavy lifting, because I am the most technically proficient. Trouble is, I just really don't have the time to be doing it.\n\nRight now our public PCs have quite possibly the worst setup imaginable for public security; they run Fortres Grande, which prevents patrons from doing anything productive at all, and essentially requires us to deactivate it to read a USB, and Windows is constantly pulling its garbage to attach emails to local accounts and making maintenance generally difficult. Fortres seems to be on the PC to act as a DeepFreeze substitute...but they don't really even remotely work the same way. The company even has software that actually does work that way (Enterprise also allows for this feature by default)! So private information isn't being cleared, and the actual function of the computer is being hindered by our IT's production environment. To make matters worse, currently no image (updated or otherwise) exists of the PCs, so basic maintenance is made even more difficult. Again, I just really don't have the time. But my goal is to move away from relying on the state IT for our needs at all.\n\nIn light of Microsoft's continued commodification and zeal for Windows 11 and further intrusive features, I thought I might just skip a step and roll out Linux on our public PCs. If I do it right, barely anyone will be able to even tell it's not Windows.\n\nI'm not really a Linux user. I've dabbled with it, and I've wanted to switch for years, but I've just never made the leap. There are a *lot* of distros, and I'm just not sure which, if any, would be best in this sort of environment. The goal is to have a PC that can perform general basic functions a person might need from a public computer that can be locked down on the backend so the drive is not written to while locked, and patrons restarting the PC will have data erased and reboot to the locked drive state/image. I'm not concerned about setting any of this up (it will be well worth it), just the actual reality of making it happen.\n\nMy primary concern is the overall functionality. Because these aren't your average Linux users using the PC, many don't understand what a text editor is or what program they need to view PDFs; they look for the icons and the names, and even functionality—while better in some cases—is not going to be 1:1 with Windows software/formatting. A docx file for example. I'm additionally concerned it would overall add more of a burden on staff who would similarly need to learn these things, and spend more time explaining to patrons how to make Linux software work the way they want it to.\n\nShould I stick with Windows? Am I making mountains out of molehills and Linux might be the solution I need? Any librarians here in the sub, or even just people who have managed similar environments? I would love your thoughts.\n\ntl;dr I'm catering to the lowest common denominator so I'm not sure if a switch to a Linux OS for widespread use is in my best interest, but my IT department is bad and Windows is only making things worse.\n\nEdit: I've spent an unnecessary amount of time justifying my job and my competency to a bunch of internet strangers, which was not the point of the post. I'm marking this Resolved. Thank you to everyone who provided legitimate advice. It's a lot to think about, but gives me some concrete options.

If they are working on something at home and then come in to make final edits and print it out? It will be high stress for everyone. \n\nBut it would be great. Maybe set up one computer with Linux Mint, somehow clearly marked as different, and see how much use it gets. If it is at capacity, switch another one, and so on, until you are down to one terrible windows machine."}

I had the same kind of feeling as when I was young and I was installing different roms on my phone. \n\nI just had to install Ubuntu on my desktop computer but I had a problem. I was not ready to let go of Windows and all the games I used to play. So I decided to install Ubuntu as a dual-boot. The operating system felt so much better on real hardware and not in a virtual machine and I was so happy with it. \n\nNow a year later I have installed Linux Mint 20.03 on my laptop as well and I think it is running better and cooler that the previous Windows 11. My only worry was how good the battery life would be on a laptop. And it has been the same compared to Windows. So no bad things to say from this either!\n\nI have noticed that I don't even play games that often because I'm having more fun for example configuring nvim, even if I'm not a programmer and I don't have much use for it, haha.

I never gave it another go as it just doesn't come up all that often when talking about distros on reddit or frankly anywhere.\n\nI've now got a Project at work to upgrade a SLES Cluster and though i could prepare by putting openSUSE on my spare SSD. And to my surprise, it is way better than most other distros i tried so far.\n\nEveryone is takling about how easy Manjaro makes it with all their Tools especially for Kernel and driver stuff. openSUSE blew me away by how easy and flawless YAST installed Nvidia drivers. Only beaten by PopOS which has the drivers out of the box.\n\nI'm running tumbleweed atm. Plasma is probably the smoothes experience i've had with KDE in a LONG time. As up to date as Arch, no hiccups, no major theming like Manjaro does and overall, just a working stock Plasma install with no fuss.\n\nThen i thought \"maybe its a corporate thing\", but no. The Repos contain everything you need for gaming. Steam, Lutris, Discord. All there. LoL on Lutris was even more straight forward than popOS.\n\nThen i had that typical \"but AUR\" argument. Signal Desktop wasn't in the repos and Signal only provides deb packages. I thought i was screwed. But nope. [software.opensuse.org](https://software.opensuse.org) even has user provided packages with a great website and an actuall 1-click install that works without any addons or plugins. All without needing the terminal or a AUR manager or such.\n\nFinally, they install BtrFS by default and have Snapshots set up for anything you do without the User having to configure it (might be a BtrFS thing, i never tried that as no other Distro defaults to it). Great.\n\nSo yeah, it's only been a couple of hours, and at the risk of rose tinted glasses (stuff could still go south): Why isn't openSUSE recommended more? It feels like the best of most worlds. Great installer, Awesome default setup, close to as current as Arch with an AUR \"clone\", and even better tools then the Manjaro stuff (imho).

I’m curious to understand why that is. If you consider yourself a \"non-fan\" of **systemd**, I’d love to hear your perspective.\n\n  \nEDIT: Thank you all very much for your comments. This got more attention than I expected and now I have some interesting views to read. I much appreciate the time you took in writing your comments.", "output": "There are a few reasons why some people don't like systemd:\n\nThe first is that systemd does a lot more than older init systems, this violates the traditional Unix principle of \"do one thing and do it well\", adherents to to the Unix philosophy hence do not like it. Systemd advocates argue that we should not be so tightly bound to the philosophy of a now dead operating system. I can see where both sides are coming from here, but lean towards systemd for this argument.\n\nThe second is that systemd has progressively \"absorbed\" other projects such as udev. Despite this, udev (a program necessary for running a modern Linux system) and these other projects remain functionally distinct, with udev being able to run perfectly well without systemd, they are merely bundled together under one source tree to \"encourage\" the use of each other. Bear in mind that Microsoft got in big trouble in the 90s for bundling their Browser with their Operating System, and were accused of anti-competitive behaviour. Of course, systemd is clearly not doing this for profit, rather it seems the devs of systemd really want people to use systemd and will go to great lengths to encourage its use.\n\nThe third problem is that systemd has introduced various features to Linux and have encouraged higher level projects, such as desktop environments to use these features, thus making systemd a dependency of these projects, ensuring that people must use systemd. Because of this, GNOME officially requires systemd to operate (but you can get it to work without systemd with some modifications). In the proprietary world this is known as [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in), and it has been compared Microsoft's underhanded \"[Embrace, Extend, Extinguish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish)\" tactics that landed them in hot water back in the 90s. It is important to note that this is not as bad as what Microsoft did, because systemd is free software, it can always be forked. However it is still pretty clear that the systemd devs haven't played entirely nice here.\n\nThe fourth \"reason\" is that the lead developer of systemd, [Lennart Poettering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennart_Poettering) is a colourful character to say the least. He is well known for his controversial opinions, and he is well known for being unapologetic in having them, and has frequently made comments that have rubbed many the wrong way. Systemd has been often desrcribed (or criticised) as becoming the \"core\" operating system in its own right, [something Poettering has certainly **not** denied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2aa34Uzr3c). Poettering is clearly a talented guy, but he's obviously got an ego, and that clearly rubs some people the wrong way."}

Instead of relying / trusting the distribution maintainers you have to trust each and every flatpak provider to keep track of bugs and security issues in all their dependencies. Critical security issue in OpenSSL? Arch, Debian, Fedora maintainers push patched OpenSSL package and all software depending on it is fixed in one go. With flatpak first every flatpak using OpenSSL has to update their used libraries and second you have to update every single flatpak.\n\nFlatpak has a use case for obscure software where the low user count does not justify it getting dedicated distribution maintainers. But IMO it should never be the default way to install software on Linux. IMO it is one step towards the security hell on Windows."}

{"id": "f12vvq", "instruction": "Did Linus really write the first iteration of Linux using machine code?", "input": "I watch Linus give a talk where he said he programmed in machine code instead of assembly. How would I hypothetically do this? Could I open a text editor today and write hexadecimal instructions and then change the file extension to run my code?\n\n\nBonus points if Linus Torvalds himself is on Reddit.", "output": "The first public release of Linux contains a smattering of x86 assembly for bootstrap, interrupt and exception handling, system call entry, and hardware access. This is necessary as C simply doesn't have any concept of any of these things. C code runs in a vacuum and assumes that _actually doing stuff with hardware_ is Somebody Else's Problem.\n\nThe rest of the codebase is C. I'd estimate that no more than about 5% of Linux 0.01 is written in assembly.\n\nIn practical terms, there's practically no reason anybody needs to deal with machine code rather than assembly nowadays. It doesn't make sense unless you're literally toggling in your bootstrap loader through the computer's front panel... and that hasn't been needed for over 40 years. So it's possible Linus may have fiddled around with machine code, but it's certainly not a prerequisite for writing an OS. I have no reason to believe it was ever done during Linux's early development.\n\n> Could I open a text editor today and write hexadecimal instructions and then change the file extension to run my code?\n\nSo there's a couple of problems with this.\n\nMachine code is just a sequence of byte values. Hexadecimal is a way for programmers to _visualise_ and _represent_ byte values, but it isn't the byte values themselves. Typing hex into a text editor isn't going to do anything useful.\n\nSecond, a modern Linux executable consists of far more than just the machine code that makes up the program. There is a whole bunch of stuff to tell the OS which bits of the executable need to be loaded into RAM, what other libraries need to be linked into the process image, and where the code actually starts.\n\nIf you use a more minimal operating system you can do what you're thinking about. COM files on DOS were literally just a process image, with the first instruction executed right at the start of the file."}

There is negligible difference between running a normally installed app and that same app in a container, in terms of memory, cpu performance, or disk speed.   There can be significant disk space overhead, however, depending on the images you use.\n\nA container image usually consists of a distro and application(s), but not a kernel or init system.  The host kernel is shared with the containers.\n\nThere are many benefits.\n\n* If set up properly (e.g. non-root user), a compromised app cannot affect your host system.   No services run in a container, only the app you specify.  No ports are accessible, except those you specify.  You can make the entire file sytem read only.  You can isolate a container's network from the host and other containers.\n* Most or all of the app setup and configuration is packaged into a container, often by an expert.  This can be a huge time savings.\n* You can start over at any time.  You can blow away a container in seconds.  If you want, you can spin it back up in the original state.\n* You can run many containers at a time.  There is little overhead except for whatever resources the apps take.\n\nTBH, I don't see many downsides compared to a traditional app install.   Maybe some people are scared of the unknown?  Keeping containers updated can be an issue.  There are other similar technologies I like better, like podman.

After all, Xorg _is_ still being maintained.\n\nBut there are other reasons for Wayland:\n\n* Security in X is largely non-existent. Any client can modify any window on the display, or eavesdrop on events on any window. This is really fundamental in the design of X &mdash; it's how window managers work, how programs that let you define hot keys work, and so on. Things like [`devilspie`](http://www.nongnu.org/devilspie2/) are only possible _because_ of X's lax security.\n\n* X is not a good fit with how modern graphics hardware works. A lot of X was designed with the idea that 2D graphical primitives would be hardware-accelerated (stippled lines, oh my!). That may have been the case in the 90s... not so much now. Modern hardware doesn't even bother accelerating those things.\n\n* While the supposed network transparency of X is often lauded, it really doesn't work very well over anything with a bit of latency. The X protocol is quite chatty, and a lot of operations require synchronisation between client and server.\n\n* X has a lot of legacy cruft that can't be removed. The core X protocol isn't even used by most X applications using modern toolkits (they typically use the XRender extension instead), but the core X protocol _needs_ to be there because it's literally \"the core X protocol\", and there _are_ a few programs that do use it. Heck, my day-to-day text editor uses Motif and still relies on the core X protocol.\n\n* A lot of hacks on X are _really_, _really_ bad hacks. I'm amazed that [drag and drop](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Draganddropwarts/) ever works at all.\n\nI should add that there _have_ been a few successes in removing the most egregious parts of X. X has historically had hardware drivers in userspace &mdash; it couldn't actually rely on the most useful features of your hardware having kernel APIs, right? &mdash; but as you can imagine that's a terrible idea all round. It's the reason X had to be run as `root`. But a lot of those hardware drivers have been removed now.\n\nXorg also once had a print server.

The most essential project is probably [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/). Every unix system needs a libc...and on gnu/linux distros that one is from the gnu project. The libc on your system is what pretty much every program uses to do \"basic\" tasks like writing files, getting time, controlling processes and threads, dealing with standard input/output, pipes...The libc either provides that functionality or redirects the request to the kernel in a unified way. It's really the most basic library in your system used by almost everything.\n\nAlso every system needs a shell...and the standard in linux is [gnu bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), a shell needs a basic set of commands like `ls`, `cp`, `mkdir`...and the standard there is [gnu coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/).\n\nOn the development level gnu provides a [compiler](https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/) for several programming langauges, provides [autotools](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/) used by many projects to deal with compiling for different target systems, provides the [default make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) implementation for the actual compile runs...\n\nMost of the tools gnu provides have alternatives...but there isn't one project that provides all the functionality gnu has, you usually have to take stuff from many different projects to get something close. You can't have a working system without gnu or one of the alternatives. So lots of the tools gnu provides are the defacto standard on linux systems."}

Primarily because of the support and licensing model. Also because they said that SuSE will run down any compatibility issues with independent software vendors that claim their code would run on \"Redhat but not SuSE\" - that was part of our support arrangement, and we never had to engage it. It just never happened.\n\nSame thing with hardware support - anything certified that would run Linux should also support SuSE.

Init system: SystemD, InitV, OpenRC, Upstart etc. This is responsible for managing system services and start the whole system up.\n\n2. Package manager: yum, dnf, apt, pacman, etc. This is vital part as that basically describes system package format and how you are going to manage (install/update/delete) packages in your system and who is taking care about resolving dependencies.\n\n3.

The same is true for all operating systems: All trust at least their company servers (windows update, apple store, ...), there are plenty of stories of malware to infect developer machines and then using for example the apple store to get distributed (google XCode Ghost for an example).\n\nLong story short: If an attacker gets your supply chain (like hijacking an install script of vim in your example), you are totally out of luck and no antivirus will help you. That is to the best of my knowledge true for all operating systems. I would further guess, having the programs which are potential attack vectors (browsers, anything which has network connections, programs you use to open files) up to date is much more important than having antivirus software, as long as you are conservative and don't execute random files from unknown sources.\n\nJust as an anecdote: I always enabled Windows Defender and never had a true positive Virus in 20 years using Windows, by following the basic rules outlined above.\n\nExcuse the novel - English is not my first language and I am too tired to answer more to the point.

Imagine each program accessing the sata bus to instruct harddisks to write data to a harddisk...that is bound to run into collisions and a total mess up. So applications are not allowed to have direct hardware access but instead have to ask the kernel to do it for them. The kernel then can coordinate the hardware access and make sure no programs interferes with the requests of other programs like writing to the same physical position on a harddisk. Then it hands the requests to the actual drivers (also part of the kernel usually) which do the hardware access (Different driver because hardware can differ in how to exactly \"talk\" to it).\n\nThe kernel alone isn't really useful..if you just boot the kernel through UEFI you will end up pretty much with a brick. Without any programs requesting functions from the kernel a kernel doesn't really do anything meaning-full. At the very least you need some program that allows user input and does something with it (like a shell).\n\nBut you usually also need a lot user-space libraries to make a useful system. While I said that programs ask the kernel that is usually not directly true. In almost all cases programs ask some library to do work for them and that library \"translates\" those requests into kernel syscalls. In theory programs could ask the kernel directly but the kernel interface it rather rudimentary and most programs simply need a more feature full interface. Easy example could be time related stuff. The kernel provides access to the build in clock of your motherboard but programs usually want timezone management, work in year/month/days/minutes/seconds and such \"comfort\". In most linux distros that is provided by the gnu userspace (mainly glibc but there are other important userspace libraries as well).

{"id": "d9fj8q", "instruction": "\"Linux doesn't need antivirus\" - Does this hold for defense-in-depth?", "input": "I'm a long time windows power user looking into migrating to Linux. One of the things I pay special attention to is cybersecurity. However, one of the common refrains I hear is \"Linux doesn't need antivirus.\" And this refrain continues even in light of viruses like Evil GNOME.\n\nI usually see three reasons as the rationale behind this:\n\n* 1) Linux market share is small and therefore not an interesting target\n\n* 2) Package repositories are vetted and limit exposure\n\n* 3) Users guidance to not do \"unsafe things\"\n\n\nHowever, I see problems with these arguments.\n\n* For the first one, while the desktop market share is small, Android has a huge market share. But more importantly, Linux dominates the server market share, and presumably commercial server market share. Wouldn't the servers of commercial users be very appealing targets?\n\n* As for vetted repositories, from a security perspective, that seems to place too much of the security element (and too much of the trust) on something a user does not control. If those repositories are targeted and packages get compromised, then what? Wouldn't the OS still install them with essentially blind trust if there are no detection capabilities like AV? Relying on assumption of trust in repositories seems to not apply any defense-in-depth concepts.\n\n* Third, as far as not doing \"unsafe things.\" Isn't web browsing inherently unsafe? Ads can contain malicious javascript. And search engine results occasionally have results to innocuous sounding sites that end up containing viruses (I've had my AV occasionally catch those). While many of those might be targeted towards Windows, what's to say there aren't ones targeting Linux, especially as more people migrate from Windows to Linux? The internet is an inherently unsafe environment, so I'm not sure how this user guidance helps when browsing the web.\n\nIn any security setup, I consider detection to be a critical component to know when something is wrong (and preferably stop a threat before it goes too far down the chain). And when I hear the reasons in the list above repeated in many places for why Linux is secure, I instinctively get concerned since those reasons seem insufficient.\n\nI'd like to get smart on Linux and migrate to it, but these types of things give me pause and confusion.

But you will quite likely face _some_ issues.\n\nBut if you are not using your computer and don't have anything important on it then what do you have to lose by trying? Some time that it takes to set everything up? You can always install windows again later on. Just make sure to backup everything you might care about on it first.\n\n---\n\nIt can also be helpful to know what programs they need to use and see if these will work on Linux or not. Sometimes it is more helpful to start using Linux friendly applications first (which most are generally cross platform) which helps to reduce the feeling that everything has changed if/when they do try out Linux."}

WPS is very compatible, modern and somewhat unstable. I haven't tried OnlyOffice or Calligra.\n\nWill your laptop even support Linux? This is much less of an issue then it used to be, but some issues that may arrise are: wifi not working, camera not working, fingerprint not working, suspend ('Sleep') not working.\n\nIn the end, it really depends how much you're willing to learn. Are you a 'techie' person normally? Then you may find this fun and intresting. Otherwise it may just be really infuriating.\n\nLastly, there is the community. Sometimes we're great, other times not so much. You will get a lot of responses as to what you should install and that alone is often a hot topic for debate.\n\nPS: Like another person said, changing OS is only half the battle. Technically apps \\_probably\\_ wont be tracking you on linux (because most big apps arent available lol, and the whole mentality of free open source apps is a bit different) but stuff like a web browser can still track you. Google is bad. Chome is bad. Get Brave, Vivaldi or firefox if you want. Don't use the Google Search engine (DuckDuckGo is my favorite (and has a lot of extra features like \"bangs\"), but Startpage is also an option and uses google-like results). Facebook is awful, so is WhatsApp, Instagram and Twitter. Facebook by design is just terrible, don't use it. WhatsApp is owned by FB so I wouldn't trust them. Get Telegram or something. Some things are trying to gather your data, but can be used anyways. For example, I wouldn't post to instagram but you look at other posts in a private tab/profile. Or if you use android install the app in an sandbox of sorts ([https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.typeblog.shelter&hl=en\\_US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.typeblog.shelter&hl=en_US)) . Twitter you can use 3rd party clients (which don't have all the features since they nerfed the API) or the website in private etc. Or just switch to a different social network (like the fediverse). Anyways I could go on for days, it depends how deep you wanna go. But trust me, privacy is a lifestyle. It requires being aware of things and learning how to protect yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr\n\n\\-Only try linux if you are prepared to learn and research\n\n\\-Definitely change your browser, search engine & communication platforms and avoid big companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft etc.\n\n\\-Consider learning how to use and installing uMatrix & uBlock Origin in your browser"}

Thank you all so much!! I hadn't realized how much I was subscribed to an urban myth without any real fact behind it; I learned a lot!!", "output": "Yeah, that is not nor has it ever been true. Linux has enjoyed higher levels of security due to not having the legacy requirements of Windows and due to how the user is expected to get software. \n\nOn windows 9X/ME and the preceding DOS with which it retained compatibility, there was no separation of privilege. This obviously meant that no privilege escalation attacks were needed. If you ran malicious software, it could do whatever it wanted and didn't need to exploit anything. Windows NT, while it implemented different user accounts with different permissions, still maintained compatibility with legacy software, often times requiring you to deactivate the increased levels of security to get software to run, which of course everyone did because the OS only exists to support the software running on it. This was greatly improved with Windows Vista that had virtual implementations of the legacy API/ABI, but of course everyone said those security improvements were stupid and turned them off because it was annoying. It wasn't until Windows 7 that there was both increased security (relative to anything XP and before,) but done so in a way that was mostly invisible to users so they didn't turn it off (usually.)\n\nThe other difference is in how you get software. With windows 98 and after, it was extremely common and expected that users would go on to the internet, download software, and execute it without much thought. If you're relying on end-user knowledge to determine what software is safe and what isn't, malware execution is inevitable.\n\nOn most Linux distros, software was being delivered by the same organization that delivered your distro. Since FOSS software can be packaged up by whomever wants to, Slackware, Debian, Redhat/Fedora, whoever can set up software repositories that sign packages with cryptographic keys controlled by the distro project, so that if you never leave that ecosystem, the chance of executing malicious software is practically nil.\n\nIt takes very little knowledge to write malware for Linux, the difficulty is in getting someone to execute it, and because of how the system works, that is a LOT more difficult.\n\nFinding vulnerabilities in discrete software packages is not really any different in windows or Linux, and due to Linux being the OVERWHELMINGLY dominant OS for servers connected to the internet, the \"popularity\" argument never held any water there. I don't know what kind of records exist between RHEL and modern Windows servers that are both set up by knowledgeable people, but RHEL has several layers of security that mitigate most attack vectors. To change something, you'd have to exploit a listening service, then successfully execute a privilege escalation attack (because the service is running as a user with minimal privileges,) then you have to worry about SELinux minimizing what that process can access even with root permissions, then you have to hope that server then has access to something exploitable, because it's likely the network engineer has it sitting behind a firewall that restricts what connections can go in or out. \n\nCan all of this break down with an incompetent system admin? Yes, but you have to go out of your way to do that on modern enterprise distributions.\n\nAny system is vulnerable, but Windows was for a long time much less secure as a fault of its design and common use. If Linux becomes less secure as it becomes more popular, it will be because individual users are turning off security features that have existed for a long time."}

Since the code you compile under Gentoo is just the Linux kernel and external libraries and apps, there is no limit on the lines of code nor any concern for whether a suckless person would define them as \"bloated\" (or not). Gentoo exists so that one is able to take advantage of the microarchitecture features of their CPU family in their Linux distro. This can certainly lead to long build times, even on powerful build machines or build farms.\n\nThe second misunderstanding (from your replies to comments) isn't _really_ a misunderstanding. You seem aware of the fact that there are certain limitations to running resource-intensive processes. Yet all of your replies so far give me the impression you're hoping you could somehow pour 3 liters of water into a 2 liter bottle.

While there is of course more to it, porting still kind of boils down to having a compiler that throws out ARM machinecode instead of x86_64 machinecode. As long as the source-code isn't CPU dependent (no direct assembly or relying on CPU specific features) it's often just a matter of recompiling the source-code.\n\nPorting to another OS is a completely different matter. You don't usually have the same APIs and even if you have you run quickly in quirks where even though functions are the same the stil behave slightly different. There is no WIN32 API on linux (lets leave wine aside for the moment), no quartz toolkit for linux....to port over source-code you need to do major rewrites. \n\nOr to illustrate it differently...debian is able to support [10 different hardware platforms](https://wiki.debian.org/SupportedArchitectures) with several more being in unsupported or un-offical state.

{"id": "olg9hj", "instruction": "Why do Linux drivers need to be recompiled on kernel updates, when Windows drivers don't ?", "input": "Hi all,\n\nNot sure if that's the right place to post this... This is something about a difference between Windows and Linux I've been wondering for a long time and could never find an answer to.\n\nOn any Linux distribution, when the kernel is updated, all of the in-tree drivers are recompiled and shipped with it. This also means that if you have any out-of-tree drivers on your system, you need to recompile them as well, hence the birth of DKMS. I totally understand that, since drivers are kernel modules and use the kernel API : it makes sense that they would need to be recompiled along with the whole kernel.\n\nBut on all my Windows systems, there's a lot of cases when I needed to use third-party drivers, including but not limited to, graphics cards. I've also had to install other drivers as well for all kinds of different hardware. But in all these years of using Windows (98, XP, 7, 10), with all the updates I've done, there are bound to have been kernel updates. But I never recall needing to go to any manufacturer's website to find an updated version of their drivers due to a Windows update. But Windows drivers also use the kernel API, namely WDM and WDF. So why is recompilation not necessary for them when the kernel is updated ?\n\nThanks !  \n\n\nEDIT / Thanks to people in the comments, the answer is : because Windows maintains a stable ABI while Linux does not. [And there are reasons](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/stable-api-nonsense.rst).", "output": "The Linux kernel doesn't have a stable API/ABI for drivers, Windows does.\n\nEDIT: See https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/stable-api-nonsense.rst for reasons why that is the case."}

For one, you will need two GPU's and you can not use the same GPU for Linux and your VM at the same time.  That means, if you want to use your fancy 5700 in a Windows VM for Adobe and then use it in a game on Linux, you will have to reconfigure Linux and reboot every time.

Steam with Proton has greatly improved over the years but it's not perfect.  There are also some other ways to run games through Wine but YMMV.

I went through the first few stpws of the installation pretty easily. And then…selecting the disk came. I stood there for a good 30 minutes making sure I chose the right option and disk. Googling and all that.\n\nWhen I was selecting the disk I noticed that one didn’t have a bar at all and underneath it it had “1 tb Kubuntu” with the Guided - Entire disk option. My thought process was “Oh the drive isn’t showing uo meaning that windows probably is keeping it away from linux”. So then I left that drove alone(which turns out it was the brand new drive) and I went to the other drive and it did show NTFS and that nice looking bar. I was then like oh ok this is were the new is and needs to be installed. I akso had this option to like resize a partition for dual boot or whatever, but I did Google what that was and I cannot remember finding anything AT ALL. I saw this installation video like a couple months old I believe and was like oh this must a a brand new feature then. \n\nI then went ahead with the thought that I selected the new drive and not the other one. I chose the Guided - Entire Disk and went ahead. Boom. Kubuntu looked beautiful when I booted into it like 😳. Ok so after having a good moment, I took a look at my drive and noticed that my ‘E:’ drive was no longer showing up. The E: drive wasthe 531GB drive. I start to worry and head to Windows.

{"id": "kl6j5w", "instruction": "A question for the people and community of Linux. The mindset of Privacy and Open-souce.", "input": "Hi! I am someone that is very interested in Linux. I still use Windows 10, but I've been messing with different distros in virtual machines to see which one I like the best.  Now it's no secret that the benefit of Linux to Windows is its privacy.  The fact the Linux is open-source really hammers the concept in, and privacy and security are one of the cornerstones of the Linux community. It's no secret that a lot of you guys really don't like Microsoft and Google for how they handle user's data. I myself have taken the liberty to switch to Firefox, an open-source browser, and switch my search engine to  DuckDuckgo.\n\nNow I know that not every Linux user cares about privacy as much as others.  There's some out there who may still even use Chrome and Google search on their own distro. But I have a question for those who care about their privacy a little bit. Those who use an Open-source browser like  Firefox, Brave, etc. and use DuckDuckGo for a search engine.\n\nWhat do the people of Linux think about Gmail and other Google services like  Drive and Youtube? I have a Gmail address and use it to create a lot of my accounts whether it would be for video game accounts and streaming services. Do the people of Linux ditch their Gmail account for an open-source alternative like ProtonMail? What about YouTube and those who own an Android phone?\n\nI guess what I am trying to ask *is it in my best interest to convert as many accounts as I can from Gmail to an open-source alternative like ProtonMail? (Accounts like Discord,  Steam, Reddit, Minecraft, Amazon, Spotify, etc).* Does a majority of Linux users do something like this? As someone who has an Android device and someone who watches Youtube a lot, am I at a  privacy disadvantage if I continue to use my Gmail address to create accounts?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nWow, I'd like to thank everybody for all the replies. I come back after a few hours and there are 70 comments and over 100 upvotes. I created this Reddit account only a few days ago to ask a few questions about Linux and how it works. This is only like my second post and I keep saying this but dang the Linux community is really nice and helpful. I'll try to read and reply to the comments but I'm going to put a few things up here first. I don't know if anybody that commented will read these edits though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I see a lot of replies with the solution of self-hosting email and getting my own domain name. While I think that this is an excellent solution, it does cost some money monthly/annually and requires some time to set up. ***I should mention that I am just a kid***. I don't want to disclose my age or anything, but I am young that I have to worry about things like tests and homework and I live with my parents. Now, this might be a solution that I consider when I am older and have a career and whatnot, but that's not until many-many years. For now, I have created a ProtonMail account. I did some digging and they encrypt, open-source, and free! I have moved a bunch of my accounts from Gmail to ProtonMail. At my age, I really don't send emails to people, I send Snaps (I really don't even send text messages and I'll touch back on this in the second point). So while I didn't have to worry about Google looking at emails since a lot of whats in my Inbox is email verification and promotions, I feel like it is better to switch to an alternative for when the times comes in the big-boy world where I write emails to colleagues and whatnot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The past few weeks I've been doing a lot of research about Linux and whether I should make my main desktop OS. While I'm still young (compared to you guys) I've been exposed to Windows since XP on my Dad's crusty blue Dell Inspiron in my early age of single digits. Fast forward some years today and I pretty much use my Windows 10 PC that I built for playing games. Now as I said before, I've been messing around in Virtual machines, watching youtube videos, and browsing Reddit to understand this operating system before I make my switch. While doing so I thought about doing the same to my Android device, but I figured that's something I would look into when I stopped receiving updates. Now with all these replies about installing a custom-ROM and degoogling phones, it's a bit overwhelming because ngl I'm more interested now in installing a custom-ROM like LineageOS, but I need to focus on one thing at a time as I haven't even installed Linux yet on my computer. I'll still reply and ask questions about the custom-ROM life but it'll be more about curiosity as it may be some time until I do that.\n   * I use my OnePlus 7 Pro for a few things. Snapchat, Youtube, Browsing the web (Now will Firefox and Duckduckgo as the search engine) and playing a good deal of COD-Mobile and a handful of other mobile games. Again, I haven't done that much looking into custom-ROMs so I don't know how this affects the play store and whatnot, but doing some surface-level searches, LineageOS does have a feature called \"Privacy guard\" but I really don't know what it does. I also want to keep the features of OnePlus like the awesome Warp Charge technology that I could miss out on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* In my post, I stated that the benefit of Linux to Windows was privacy and security. I should've cleared that up more because that's obviously not the only thing that Linux has over Windows. Linux is a kick-ass operating system and offers a whole lot in which MacOS and Windows don't. I just framed it in that way because this question was about the 'Privacy and Security' part of Linux, and the userbase deals with google particularly as a lot of Linux users use Firefox and DuckDuckgo as a search engine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that's all I have for this edit. I want to say thank you so-so much for all the replies. You guys should be proud of establishing a community like this. I'll be making the rounds trying to reply to each of you. Again, I'm young and probably shouldn't be worrying about all of these privacy shenanigans but hey sometimes you do what you gotta do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "output": "From my point of view, OoenSource is not about privacy or security. It is about freedom and transparency. This puts some responsibility on the users and one side effect is, that people who care about security and privacy can easily identify issues.\n\nSo, what about using google, etc. I wouldn’t say the majority is migrating stuff away from everything „closed“. Since most Linux users are very interested in technology and therefore know more about „what’s behind the curtain“, there may be a bigger movement then in let’s say apple users.\n\nFrom my personal perspective: I am moving a lot of stuff to my own machines. Using things like reddit, YouTube, Udemy, LinkedIn, etc is still true for me, due to various reasons."}

This makes it easier for malware to become entrenched into the system and harder for users to stop unwanted processes from running.\n\nWindows also does a lot of bookkeeping.  Since it doesn't have a proper package repository, it has to track each individual `dll` (I'm guessing).  Then there's the whole SxS mess.\n\nSettings are another mess.  Some can still be changed only from the control panel.  Some require going into multiple nested dialogs before the actual setting can be changed.

Thanks in advance!", "output": "They serve the same purpose as headers for any C/C++ code base. Assuming you don't know these languages, they essentially let other programs \"see\" what is defined in the library.

When you include headers from another program, the preprocessor is aware of what public definitions are in there, and you can compile your program against it.\n\nIt is more nuanced than that, but that is the gist in layman terms.

Elitism. Ubuntu is easy to install and very user friendly, and some people think Linux is better off with a higher barrier to entry (that's probably not why, but I can't think of a better reason why having the option for ease would be a bad thing)\n\n1a. It's the most mainstream, and the GNU/Linux community is full of a bunch of hipsters who like to do things their own way (not a bad thing)\n\n2. Bloat. The current Arch Linux .iso (a distro known for being lightweight) is 786.3MB. The current Ubuntu (22.04.1) .iso is 3649.55MB. Granted, Ubuntu has a GUI installer... but you get the idea.\n\n3. Corporatism. Ubuntu is developed by [Canonical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_(company)), a private company that makes $4.4 million a year (honestly not that much, considering the 505 employees). While not a bad thing in itself, there's an understandable distrust of companies in general, even though ones like Red Hat and Canonical have helped develop a lot of important shit like X11 and Wayland.\n\n4. Snaps. Historically, they're slow, bloated, and handling permissions is a pain. What makes it worse is that the back end is proprietary, controlled entirely by Canonical. If you want to release your program as a snap, Canonical has to approve. Make a change they don't like? Snap, there goes your program.\n\n4a. 22.04 shipped with Firefox installed as Snap by default. Removing it, then trying `sudo apt install firefox` will install the Firefox snap. Removing snapd and trying `apt` will install snapd, then Firefox as snap. You *can* get around this, but the fact you *need* to is unbelievable. Absolutely unacceptable. If I wanted to mess with system files so I can do an action I otherwise don't have access to, I'd use Windows.\n\n4b. RedHat developed the flatpak system which has similarly sandboxed applications, but with better support for shared libraries AND the back end is open source. So if RedHat goes full Zucc, we can continue using Flatpak.\n\n5. Telemetry. No longer an issue, but the Ubuntu installer used to have an opt-in option for [data collection.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/linux/ubuntu-reveals-desktop-telemetry-for-the-first-time/) Now, it was open source and everything, but ofc the Linux community is *very* against telemetry/spyware as a whole.\n\n6. Spyware. Again, no longer an issue, but it was for years. The default option was to SEND AMAZON YOUR SEARCH QUERIES FOR ADS. [source, kind of.](https://fossbytes.com/ubuntu-20-04-lts-drops-amazon-web-app/amp/)\n\nThere are definitely others, but for me, the whole snap thing definitely makes me dislike Ubuntu.

I haven't done an exhaustive comparison but it's starting to feel like a deliberate (poor) design choice that just goes ignored by app developers or perhaps can't be changed.  The logical focus should be either nothing (much less annoying) or the filename field (ideal). Not the search box because who searches for a filename when they are saving a file, honestly?  People just want to save a file, and if you happen to repeat filenames, the OS will warn you if you are about to overwrite the file.

To install the apps separate from your system, Flatpak, Snap and AppImage install apps separate from the system, the apps need to bundle everything they use instead of using it from your system, so they are larger and take longer to load.

They've added arguments and commands that aren't part of the POSIX specification, and benchmarks have repeatedly shown they're slower than more POSIX-compliant alternatives such as Toybox and musl libc.\n\nAnother issue is, yes, licensing. GPLv3 is much more restrictive than GPLv2, and it's added anti-tivoization clause is the reason Linus hasn't updated the kernel license. Tivoization means hardware that includes a modified version of the software in it's firmware, which the hardware will fail to work if it's changed in any way. Linus feels this restricts product manufacturers who might want to include Linux in the firmware (and frankly, I agree, I think the anti-tivoization clause is an unnecessary restriction and really examplifies the third reason).\n\nThe final reason is GNU is **radical** free software. Richard Stallman has been repeatedly described as difficult to work with because of his strong ideals, and on the GNU website is an article called \"Optionally Free Is Not Enough\" which shows how strong those beliefs are widespread through the organization.\n\nEdit: Imagine getting downvoted for answering a question ad nauseam.

{"id": "g8mdiz", "instruction": "How I switched to Linux, and hopefully it can help others.", "input": "I just recently switched to Linux on my main computer a couple of weeks ago, I've used Linux on my laptop (research and Youtube machine) years ago, but have never really done anything with it, essentially my laptop tasks could be performed by a Chromebook, I only use Firefox on it for research for videos or watching Youtube videos, making the occasional post on forums, etc, essentially 100% browser based.\n\nHowever, this did give me a platform for testing, since there is never anything on this, I can test things, figure stuff out, break the OS, do clean installs to start over, it was a safe testing platform for trial and error. So my suggestion here is if you have mission critical data, or actual work you need to get done on your main computer, try finding a cheap option first to play with, an old laptop, an old desktop, maybe find something at goodwill or online classifieds, install the distro you're looking into, and play with it from there, start learning terminal, you're new best friend.\n\nOnce you're ready to dive deeper down this rabbit hole like I was, I made a HUGE list over the next week, every time I used my desktop, I made a list of every program I used, and everything I did with it. A good starting point is go to control panel and open remove programs, go through that list and just look at everything you have installed, and write down everything you installed that you use.\n\nNext comes the research, start looking for alternatives or workaround for everything there. So for me, it's all gaming and content creation, so the main games I play are Forza Horizon 4, and Halo, both are Microsoft only, so I had to find alternatives, turns out, if you buy a game on the Microsoft Store, it's cross play, you can just download it on an Xbox One, it's not 60fps because it's an original Xbox One, but sure, works for me. I'll just wait for the new Xbox to comes out and that solves my 60fps issue, I was going to buy one anyway so problem solved.  \n \\- So with this example here, not all alternatives are on your computer, you may be able to find other alternatives on other devices.\n\nNext is testing my hardware, I have some DJ equipment, MIDI devices, an external DAC for my mic, it uses proprietary software from the company that glitches out on install if you don't install it correctly on Windows, so using this on Linux was a scary thing for me, if it was that hard to getting everything working on Windows, I was expecting a nightmare to try and figure it out on Linux, turns out, no driver needed, it works straight out of the box, better on Linux than it does on Windows, as for the DAW, I use FL Studio, and with some research, I found out it works flawlessly with wine, a little bit of start up work getting it working, but there are lots of helpful guides out there, and it works just as it did in Windows, but I actually noticed that even though this is a Windows/macOS program, and I'm using the Windows version of it with wine, it's actually using less system resources when making really complicated projects, so even though it's not designed for it, using an alternative workaround for install, it works better than it did on Windows.  \n \\- So with this example, you can see that it's not just switching to Linux, it's also switching to a better environment in some cases as some stuff just works better on Linux, even if the hardware and software was designed for Windows/macOS only.\n\nNow finally we have the two programs I use that do not work on Linux, The first one being Adobe Photoshop. I need an alternative, everyone knows, GIMP, it's the go to standard, works great, always works, it's super solid and just ready to go out of the box, if you feel it looks a little dated which I did, well, it's theme-able too, so you can just download themes to give it the look you want, and if I had known about GIMP before learning Photoshop, I never would have used Photoshop.  \n \\- So what we get from this is the free open-source alternative is actually as good as the professional paid alternative, so not only was the paid version holding me back, but I ended up picking up the free alternative straight away, and I really have no reason to go back to Photoshop, even if I did return to Windows.\n\nNext would be Adobe Premiere Pro, I've wanted to switch to something else for a LONG time with all of the random crashes, even using the latest versions, latest Nvidia driver, DDU installs to make sure everything is as stable as possible, didn't matter, it always just randomly crashes, it drove me insane knowing that I was paying $50 a month for Creative Cloud for a program that seems like it was made by a crack team in one night with basically no support that actually helps (they literally asked me if I tried restarting my computer, as if that wasn't my first step into trying to resolve Premiere issues), the worst part was if I used the auto-save function, if it crashed while making an auto-save, it would corrupt the entire project file and I wouldn't be able to reopen it causing me to start all over from the beginning WAY TOO MANY TIMES.. Which is where I did RESOLVE (pun intended) my issues. DaVinci Resolve. I am so mad I spent so many years learning Premiere Pro only to find out that not only is DaVinci Resolve free, they have a Linux version (it's designed for CentOS, so a small fix to get it working), but I decided to try it on Windows since it's cross platform, free, I really had nothing to lose, loaded up a test project in Premiere Pro, 10 minute video, 1080p, default .mp4 h.264 encoding settings, it took 12-14 minutes each test using an i9-9900k with 32GB of RAM and a 1080ti, It was using 20-22GB of RAM, it was steady at 20GB but peaked at times to 22GB of RAM usage.  \nThis is where it gets interesting, on Windows with DaVinci Resolve, same 10 minute test project recreated, same default .mp4 h.264 render, 8-10 minutes every render, but wait.. there's more.. 8-10GB RAM usage... Faster render times, and LESS than HALF of my system resources being used. (I was only concerned with needing more RAM, I don't have numbers for CPU/GPU usage as they have never been an issue). So now I was sold, I just accidentally made a huge improvement in my workflow by looking for Linux alternatives that still work on Windows, so now I have alternatives, and I can learn how to use them on Windows while I'm comfortable knowing what to do.  \nOnce I felt comfortable with DaVinci Resolve (which I picked up faster than Premiere Pro because of how easy it is to use), I was ready for the switch.  \n \\- So this here just goes to show that looking for alternatives might be the thing you needed all along, because I made a huge discovery that not only helps my computer not break a sweat, but also saved me money because I canceled my Creative Cloud subscription, so I'm now saving $50 a month, and I was worried that if I switch my workflow over to 4/6/8K I'm going to need a 64/128GB RAM kit, turns out, I don't need to buy anything and saved myself from unnecessary hardware upgrades due to a poorly optimized program haha.\n\nLast thing to learn here is that there are workarounds, just because my success was found on Windows, it was not on Linux, for instance my motherboard, it's a Gigabyte Aorus Xtreme Z390, which means it has an ESS Sabre DAC built in, and out of the box, Linux tries to use the Intel audio drivers which don't work with ESS Sabre, so this means every audio port on the back of my computer doesn't work. I did find out that you can use the front Headphone jack as that's not controlled by the DAC so the Intel drivers work for that, but I did have to do a lot of research to figuring out my sound issue, and so far I have still not figured out the rear ports, my work around was I bought a 3.5mm to 1/4\" cable to go from the 1/4\" headphone jack on my external DAC, and I routed the cable down to the 3.5mm port on the Logitech stereo, and then I use a different pair of USB headphones. So now all Audio is externally controlled, and USB output, not ideal, but it works and hasn't stopped working or had any issues. So I have a method that works, and keeps me up and running until I can resolve the ESS Sabre issue.  \n \\- So from this you should see that even though there was an issue stopping productivity, there are workarounds to get you up and running while you figure out a better fix, just because you got it working doesn't mean it's done, you can always improve as perfection is impossible\n\nThe first impression issues didn't stop there, I got into a huge issue with NTFS drives not working out of the box (this was a Pop\\_OS! 20.04 thing) but I fixed it by backing up all of my drives and formatting them all to EXT4 (which ended up showing huge performance improvements, basically got faster drives for free just by using EXT4 instead of NTFS so I'm kind of glad I ran into that issue as I would have left them NTFS for ever and never known about the vast improvements of EXT4 over NTFS.\n\nYou thought we were done with start up impressions? Not just yet, next was DaVinci Resolve, like I mentioned earlier, it's designed for CentOS, so there's some workarounds you need to do to convert the .run into a .deb, so it wasn't as straight forward as I was expecting, which took quite awhile for me to figure out how to get everything working perfectly, but once it's working, I found out it didn't stop there, for whatever reason, DaVinci Resolve, or Blackmagic rather, doesn't support h.26x formats in Linux, this means .mp4 h.264, basically my entire workflow, but, there's options, convert and change the cameras to .mov, well no, I changed my camera over to .mov, turns out the camera shoots .mov h26x formats lol, It uses the older codec of .mov, so, converting was my option, which is where I learned all about a wonderful little program called FFmpeg, and I absolutely love this.  \nYou just tell it the directory in terminal, have all your settings figured out, bingo bango, it's off to the races, and it will convert every file in a directory from one format to another, places them in a folder and everything. Now, you might be thinking, well, this is a whole extra step over Windows, why is this good?  \nWell, it's because of how UNBELIEVABLY FAST DaVinci Resolve is on Linux, I had to make a video so I wasn't able to use a test project, but the final video I made was around 14 minutes, set to default .mov settings, and rendered.. ready for this.. 2 minutes.. and 42 seconds.. LESS than 3 minutes for a LONGER video than my test projects on Windows.  \n \\- So this is the last thing to make sure you remember when swtiching to linux, is that even though there is an alternative program, it was more work to install it, there's extra steps now to use it, there are hidden gems in there, because even though I have to take some time to run a quick code in terminal to convert all of my video files after shooting a video, I just type that in, walk away, make a coffee, it's done when I get back, no big deal, but for how much time I save rendering videos. I can never go back to Windows again.\n\nSo some closing marks here to remember, make a list, find alternatives, find workarounds, pros and cons of each, if something is more work, it's not always bad, make sure you like what you're doing, because at the end of the day, if switching is stressing you right out and you're pulling your hair out trying to get it all working, than is it worth it? Just remember why you're leaving Windows for open-source, why you want the ability to do anything you want on your computer, and how not only it's free, but like me, you saved tons of money by switching (because I saved $50 a month on my Adobe Creative Cloud Subscription and didn't have to buy more RAM because of DaVinci Resolve).\n\nSo go out and try it, start with an old computer you can break, screw the OS right up, do some system updates and just shut it off half way, boot it back up and try to figure out how to fix it, give yourself problems to overcome, because the better you are at solving them, the less they become \"problems\" rather than challenges to be conquered .", "output": "Great story, and there were a few new things for me too, despite being a 20+ years Linux user.

So copies started emerging. Some free, some not. The license was expensive and hard to get so people were looking for (and making) alternatives.

If the ones you need are available, or you are able to adapt to the alternatives we have over here, then go ahead, become one of us.

What was it like before that era?", "input": "EDIT: I meant to title this as \"When did the Linux Desktop experience become more user friendly...\"\n\nI've only been using Linux since 2020, and since I tried it 4 years ago, it quickly became my main driver. I hardly miss Windows. There's so much greatness with open source programs and community.\n\nHowever, there's a lot I don't know about Linux's history, although some folks have shared these experiences:\n\n1. Driver and hardware issues\n2. A time before Proton and WINE was able to help us play Steam games\n3. A time before Pipewire and Wayland (I never really used Pulseaudio, I've mainly used Wayland since it seemed like the next best thing, as I kept hearing the Xorg was being phased out)\n4. Printer issues (which is still sometimes an issue for me).\n\nFortunately, I don't care to buy the latest and greatest in PCs, so older hardware naturally becomes more compatible before I ever upgrade.\n\nNow, I know there's a whole evolution of Desktop Environments, which is more about the GUI, but I figured the GUI has always gotten better in every iteration. I guess it could be incorporated to my question(?) There's just so many great DEs to choose from, hah.\n\nBut would anyone disagree that Linux is in a great spot to be more mainstream than before? Especially thanks to Steamdeck, Proton and WINE communities, and etc.\n\nWhat was it like before this time? Before this era?", "output": "It seemed to get better sometime between 2003 and 2008 with Ubuntu coming in and supporting the deb-based community.  (Ubuntu was the Linux Mint of its day.)  I would also say that in the past, there were fewer GUI interfaces to do certain things and so you'd need to know how to use the terminal more.\n\nFrom about 1998 to 2003 I was on RPM based systems (Red Hat and Mandrake), but at the time rpm seemed to prone to getting \"stuck\" in such a way that took some extra understanding to recover.  (It's fine now, of course.). I think the term was \"dependency hell\" and it was a much more real thing back then, sometimes causing the rpm db to have issues.\n\nThe main issues for me were hardware support, as I didn't actually buy hardware that was known to be compatible with Linux at the time.  I vaguely remember always having some issues with network support, and possibly getting X11 to work right.  On the network side you had to deal with \"winmodems\" if you were using dialup and didn't want to spend extra $$ on a \"real modem.\"  On the X11 side, just manipulating the conf file to get the display to work in a reasonable resolution.  (I STILL have to deal with network support issues sometimes, but it's easier--I don't remember the last time I ever had a problem with the display just not working automatically.)\n\nMy memory isn't what it used to be, but I think around 2003 - 2005 I started moving over to deb-based systems because dependencies were just handled better and things didn't break as much.  But again, any issues always revolve around hardware support, especially network support.\n\nI stuck with Debian for a while, and I didn't hop onto Ubuntu right away, but when I did things just started working better.  Ubuntu had brought some much-needed polishing to deb-based systems and hardware support didn't seem like something you always had to deal with after the initial install.  Ubuntu also contributed that software back to Debian.  For a while there (probably based on Debian free/nonfree policies) Ubuntu was definitely easier than Debian to install and run, but I don't think that's the case anymore.\n\nWINE has been around for a very long time, but it didn't always have such great support for different software.  I remember using WINE soon after (within a couple years at least) after using Linux.\n\nI'm sure someone will correct me if I'm mis-remembering anything."}

Never have I experienced a system that recovered from this.", "output": "The OOM killer is the absolute last resort for the kernel before it panics, it will only get invoked if the kernel cannot find enough memory and is cornered into either sacrifice a process of panic.\n\nThat unfortunately means, it can trash for quite a while before it's completely stuck and invokes the OOM killer. If it can continuously pause programs and evict their code and then trash something else and reload it back from disk, it will do that. It was designed with the assumption there's some swap available to temporarily offload some stuff, but even then, that is also pretty slow and usually results in a lockup regardless. Well, it's not really locked up, it will eventually process everything, just ridiculously slowly. Ideally while this is happening, userspace processes are shutting down and will eventually free up enough memory that the system survives the incident. In practice you're OOM'ing because something is leaking memory so it doesn't really work out.\n\nThe kernel tries to not get too involved with userspace. There are plenty of facilities to ensure a program cannot ever use all the memory, cgroups being one. There's also userspace OOM killers that can detect the imminent trashing and kill a process, which being a userspace program, maybe it's got a list of things it can sacrifice first that are preferable rather than picking your database.\n\nAs with many things in the Linux ecosystem, a lot of those choices are left to the user, or otherwise the distribution. Ubuntu AFAIK ships with systemd-oomd enabled by default, or at least used to. On a desktop is makes sense to just kill Chrome, on a server it might be preferable to just wait a while for your database to shut down cleanly than have it killed and have to restore from backup. Or maybe it's a web server worker process, and it's better to kill it and abort a bunch of requests in favor of immediately going back to being able to serve hundreds of requests. The kernel doesn't know, you do.\n\nThis is a great article on the topic of swap and the OOM killer: https://chrisdown.name/2018/01/02/in-defence-of-swap.html"}

Older X11 apps can run on Wayland via XWayland, a semi-sandboxed compatibility layer that runs X11 apps as if they were Wayland apps, in a fully-conformant X.org environment.

{"id": "w0otd3", "instruction": "Why I am biased against snaps and flatpaks", "input": "I recently read an inquisitve post about why flatpaks were hated, which gained many responses. But none of them seemed to go suffeciently deep on what their long term effects will be on linux ecosystem. Here I will try to do that and show why I arrive at the conclusion of opposing them, and hopefully gain some new insights from healthy discussion.\n\nI will try to discuss their effects, benefits or disadvantages seperately on users, distro maintainers and developers.\n\n# Users\n\nThe primary benefits cited for end users are:\n\n1. **Security** : I think there is a net positive on the whole, but some aspects of it are not as widely discussed as they should be. Aside from the fact that the security benefits are easily nullified, and in some cases required to be compromised for proper functioning of many programs, even its presence is questionable for certain programs. Take for example the browser. Is it essential to sandbox the browser from system when they are already eating monstrous amount of RAM for isolating and sandboxing everything on content level? In many such cases, argument of security alone seems unreasonable for making the choice of repo software vs flatpaks/snaps.\n2. **Convenience** : I think this is something most people will relate to more readily. It is a breath of fresh air to install something in a single click instead of hunting for PPAs and external repos or compiling software. It is however redundant for many distro models like that Arch/AUR and Nix, and may actually compromise user choice and force users towards using snaps/flatpaks exclusively as I will discuss later.\n\nAs for the disadvantages to users, they include:\n\n1. **Higher resource consumption** : They take more storage space, have longer cold start times, and may consume more slightly more memory, though they are primarily snap issues and most flatpak users would not even bother with these. So I will not consider them disadvantages as such.\n2. **System integration** : It is a balancing act with security and I think will be resolved sooner than later, though it will continue to give minor headaches to future users.\n3. **Elimination of choice** : I shall expand on it while discussing about distro mantainers and developers.\n\n# Distro Maintainers\n\nAll in all it makes their work much easier. They can relegate the responsibilty of distributing all but the core software to flatpaks and snaps, given that being distro agnostic is one of their main selling points. The simple result will be distro repos become more and more sparce and users will have to use them unless they consider manually compiling or hunting ever more rarer 3rd party repos. This is one way that user choice will be adversely affected. I doubt that major distros like debian or arch will go this route any time soon, though ubuntu and fedora to some extent seem ardent on this path. This will also have the effect of eliminating distro diversity (which may be a good thing in eyes of many), since most distros will only be seperated by artwork as the routes of software distribution, which is what primarily differentiates distro families, consolidates to these container formats.\n\nI also expect that community efforts like AUR will become less useful and may possibly die unless a hardcore commmunity of flatpak/snap haters band together and continue to avoid them. I personally would dislike that scenario as AUR makes these formats redundant for me. Had arch/arch based distros held the majority share, I doubt that even the idea of them would have ever occured, since they are primarily solving the issues for distros that insist on using older (but stable) software, and users who insist to use them for general desktop usecases, with no good reason to do so for some past years.\n\n# Developers\n\nI think this is the group that benefits the most and for whom these container formats were envisioned for. They allow them to save effort on supporting multiple distros, and spare them time and effort to improve their software instead of keeping up with ever updating dependencies. However over long term, I predict the following trend:\n\n1. **Security issues from old dependencies** : Do not change what works. Why update dependencies that already work? An additonal justification to avoid updating them would be that they are sandboxed anyways. Its easily avoidable if the stores assign a minumum version, though flatpaks/snaps distributed from other sources can still continue to do so. However I fail to see how the stores could monitor every possible dependency, and stuff like npm modules make it almost impossible from my perspective, though I would be interested in possible solutions to above problem. And God forbid there turn up multiple stores with different targets and strategies for minimum dependencies, or it will be repeat of the distro fragmentation situation again.\n2. **Software exclusive to flatpaks/snaps** : And no, not just the proprietary ones. Assuming that stores set a minimum version for dependencies (which they should). Developers will keep using as old libraries as possible, as long as their software doesn't require any additional feature present in newer one. Given the usual length of LTS support, they are likely to be 5 years or possibly even older. In span of 5 years, many libraries go through multiple version updates, with many requiring significant changes in programs utilizing them. Leaving aside any security issues that may result due to it, this will lead to that program working improperly with newer dependencies bundled with the more up to date distros. Such programs will be unusable outside flatpaks or snaps they are made for, or will require significant effort from community or distro maintainers to be functional with latest libraries. A recent example for the same is that of firefox. About 2 months ago, some firefox users faced broken videos after OS update even when they were previously working without problem. It was only present in natively installed firefox, not in flatpak or snap. Turned out it was ffmpeg 5 update. Flatpaks and snaps used version 4, while distro repos updated to 5 and broke videos. Now had firefox primarily focused on flatpaks or snaps, they would have not updated to use ffmpeg 5, which would mean that anyone trying to install through repos would have broken experience, unless the distro also patched firefox to work with ffmpeg5. Given that they promise developers less efforts, I find it unlikely that most developers would bother with keeping up to date with dependencies, assuming that flatpaks and snaps have become the primary method of distribution\n\nIn my conclusion, these container formats are a solution for the developers, by the developers, with some benefit to distro maintainers, and questionable benefit to users. The problems that flatpak/snap claim to solve for users could be solved in multiple ways with less development effort, had that been the aim.\n\nOf course all this is assuming that they become the de facto method for software distribution. As long as they remain a secondary backup method to do the same, most of the above would be paranoia", "output": "Y'all missed the most obvious one of all. \n\nIf everything is in a flatpack or snap, then whoever controls the shared library builds is basically making the distro. \n\nNow you've got one set of binaries to look for exploits in. One build chain to try and compromise with backdoors. \n\nYou're again beholden to whomever packages stuff to get updates and such. As well as for which features are enabled/disabled.\n\n\"OH but you can rebuild them yourself to enable/disable features and/or use newer libraries\"\n\nOh so I should just build gigantic hunks from source all the time then? Great step forward.\n\n\"Just change which snap/flatpack repo you use to one that builds them how you need them\"\n\nSo we're back at the same distro situation as before just now with snaps/flatpacks mixed in. Great.\n\nSee the issue is for all the issues they \"solve\" they don't really solve anything.  \n\nI'm pretty sure there is an XKCD about this. Something about competing standards."}

I am also concerned about using very outdated software since in some cases I need to run new versions of programs for study/work.\n\nFor these reasons, I think that going with Ubuntu would be a better choice, with a huge community, a lot on new software available right away, etc. But I am also aware of the fact that Ubuntu is a bit bloated with preinstalled crap, it is probably a bit slower than Debian on average, and there have been concerns about privacy in the past, as I remember reading that some telemetry and other bullshit was running in the background in recent versions, which turns me off as it seems like it would just go towards the direction of Windows over time.\n\nI am happy to consider other distros, but I would stay away from very small distros, or highly skill-intensive systems like Arch (I just read is not advised for new users) and I would also stay away from super commercial, bloated distros.\n\nAny advice?\n\nThanks for reading all of this!", "output": "PopOs would be another choice from Ubuntu, also isn't Linux Mint the choice for ex windows for the look?"}

I'm on a late 2016 Macbook Pro 13\" but thankfully I've never had the dreaded keyboard problem as I keep my computer in clamshell mode 95% of the time while I';m on an external keyboard and display..\n\n**Where's I'm at currently:** \n\nIt's time to consider getting a new computer for me as my Mac, hardware-wise, is getting a bit long in the tooth and slowing down.  Also, when I go on battery power, my MBP completely shuts down when I reach 38% battery life. I've tried to reset the SMC to clear that up to no avail. So I'm a bit sore on the whole planned obsolence deal because I can't simply replace the battery, add more RAM, and keep going. In other words, the computer feels like I don't really own it and just a rental.\n\nI do like the MacOS itself, however, I'm considering jumping ship to Linux in search of something better all-around (hardware + software). I'm specifically considering a Lemur Pro with Pop!\\_OS 20.04 because I love what I read about System 76 and how they tie in the OS with the hardware really well. That's one of the things that attracted me to Apple way back when because it helps create a better experience, in my opinion.\n\n**My Use case:** \n\nI'm stricly a business/personal enjoyment user, meaning, I'm not a developer or gamer, nor do I use my computer for video production or photo editing tasks. I spend my time in Brave, email, and Word/Excel documents for which I use OnlyOffice desktop version as it supports docx/xlsx formats amazingly well. I have Zoom calls, browse through my Photos/iPhoto archive.\n\n**My fears:**\n\nI read lots about people moving from Windows to Linux which makes sense. Probably for overlapping reasons why people move from Windows to Mac. I'm concerned that moving to Linux will be more headache than it is worth and the end result won't lead to a better experience, just different, or perhaps worse even.\n\nIs there anyone here that has left MacOS behind and can offer advice on what I should expect and ways to overcome any pitfalls coming from a Mac?

Have amazing bits of open software been excluded from the Linux scene due to omitted or forgotten licenses in the past?\n2. Are there any methods for asking this to become licensed outside of messaging the dead account over Github that are even possible?\n\nAlso, Elviosak, if you're out there, I'll totally buy you pizza if you slap a license on Wing Menu so I can finally use it.", "output": "If the license is omitted or forgotten, then it's not open source/free software.

How many codepens, gists, and other things are floating around there with no license?\n\nFrom a copyright perspective this means you cannot copy the code, you may or may not even be able to legally run the code depending on jurisdiction. The code is the intellectual property of the author and the author alone. Any duplication and distribution of the code would be a violation of their copyright if done beyond reasonable for fair use. This is why no one will want to touch it. For the code in question, since it's on github, you're allowed to make a copy of it via git and fork it into your own github repo, but anything beyond that is not automatically permitted without the author's permission.\n\nThe best way to think of it is think of the code the way you would a book. A book in the library is free for you to read, but you cannot make a copy of the book and redistribute it. Just because you can read it doesn't give you any additional rights to it beyond being able to read it.\n\nSo the answer to your second question is: Short of waiting 70 years after the author dies, nothing beyond contacting the author and asking them to put a license will help.\n\nEDIT: I realized there is one other way to do it: If you're a multi-billionaire you can do a hostile takeover of Microsoft and update the Terms of Service of Github that forces all code to be GPL by default and make it retroactive whereby anyone who doesn't delete their repo by (insert grace period for after the updated terms here that help make the terms binding by making inaction a signal of acceptance) will be retroactively relicensed under GPL if no other license is present"}

I have had to  hack a laptop to use an external PSU because the power jack and the associated solder pads were damaged and could not be used. So I worked out how to do this through the battery terminal but as is the trend these days, smart batteries give back far more than a voltage reading. I simulated the thermal runaway load and that was fine. It booted but then about 45 seconds later it would freak the battery is not reporting a value and immediately power off. \n\nSo I did my best by nulling systemd hibernate and suspend targets, so it could not execute them, but now  the kernel itself is being trigged somehow, and it is forcing a shutdown.\n\nHow can I get it to just ignore the battery as if it was a desktop or server with a dedicated PSU? I don't want it to be treated as a laptop, I want it to be treated as a server.\n\nAnd yes, even booting Linux distros  live or in text/emergency  mode suffers the same issues. \n\nWill I have to craft a bespoke distro to try and disable battery monitoring ? Is that even possible these days? \n\nAnd yes I know in theory I can decode the I ^^2 C commutation between the battery and the laptop and then lie to the laptop about the battery, but 2 problems with that. \n\n* The battery cannot be charged without the laptop and the power jack is kaput, and it has already depleted over the last few months\n\n*  Sniffing on I ^^2 C comms requires a logic analyser between the laptop and the battery and takes time (see above)  and I don't really have that kit to hand. \n\nI do have an I ^^2 C adapter  plugged into the PIKVM I am using to manage the laptop remotely and it is connected to the laptop 'data pins'  but it is hard to decode one side of the conversation. \n\nBecause of the PIKVM I can boot ISOs remotely to try out things, but ideally I would like to just modify the OS that was already on the laptop which is Debian Testing \n\nWhat annoys me, if I fixed it for a few months  and all was good. Until I had to do some maintenance on the chassis and rebooted. Some update must have installed itself in the meantime  and caused it to shut down again. \n\nThe added  complication of course is that debugging can only be done in 45s to a minute worth of time before it force shuts down. \n\nAny advice/insights appreciated. \n\nThanks.\n\nEdit: \n\n#  IT IS NOT A FIRMWARE PROBLEM \n\n# THE LAPTOP IS NOT POWERING OFF SUDDENLY LIKE PULLING THE PLUG. IT IS SAFELY SHUTTING DOWN BECAUSE IT IS TOLD TO WITH A POWER OFF COMMAND\n\n\nEdit 2: \n\nOk so I managed to boot into single user more sans the battery module, and actually it appears it is not a battery signal at all. It says this \n\n    Jul 03 18:23:31 vmlap systemd-logind[1953]: Power key pressed.\n    Jul 03 18:23:31 vmlap systemd-logind[1953]: Powering Off...\n    Jul 03 18:23:31 vmlap systemd-logind[1953]: System is powering down.\n\nNow for reference I have made my own 'ATX' control by hooking into the ribbon cable that went to the power switch and making contact with a relay that is triggered by the Raspberry PI GPIO. It could be now I come to think of it that the relay is somehow triggering by something from the pi and powering off. The problem did start happening when things were very hot here, and I am wondering to if an update to the PIKVM has now updated and changed things. Either way I shall investigate, but thanks to all the suggestions, and certainly I will look to making a cleaner boot in future.\n\n\n**Edit Resolved:** OK, So I made a couple of assumptions I should not have based on previous experience. It turns out it is not the system powering itself off because of the battery. Though I will say, this is what happens if it thinks the battery is broken in a laptop context. So, a caveat for all you who are looking to recycle old laptops.  \n\nIt appears, despite working for months the circuit I built to emulate the power button with a relay and driver from the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi, is floating now. I have traced it back to the transistor having a quiescent current that is being provided by earths from two sources. Not sure how, seeing as they are all connected to the same PSU, but the earth from the PI and the earth from the mother board are ~ .5-.7V different. This was not a problem before, but something about the very hot days we got a few months back must have changed something. A capacitor somewhere or something.  \n\nEither way, the solution is to just pull down the earth to one of two sources and that should solve the problem. True, I can also ignore the power button as well in Linux and that would be easier. But I feel more comfortable finding a hardware solution that will be more consistent. \n\nSo thank you for your help and all the suggestions. For sure, I did not think of the battery module and so maybe if I can disable that on boot it will ignore the battery in future.

Should I stick with it?", "input": "I've tried to do this multiple times and always end up giving up midway. Last weekend I decided to give it another go and installed Fedora on my computer alongside Windows for dual boot. And the amount of frustrating things I have to deal with is so overwhelming that I am having a hard time convincing myself to stick with it. Issues I ran into include:\n\n1. Nvidia. I installed the driver and it's mostly fine but brightness of builtin monitor doesn't work. I tried all sorts of fixes online but nothing worked so far.\n2. HiDPI is a pain in the butt. I need fractional scaling and different scaling on two monitors. Wayland does it best but legacy apps look like crap, and getting it right on X11 took me such a long time, and it felt like a hacky solution at best (xrandr scale + GNOME scaling)\n3. App installation is more confusing than I thought. I was under the impression that you can use things like dnf, apt, or whatever the distro provides and install everything that way. Now I'm seeing things like Flatpak, snap, AppImages, etc. I get the free/proprietary concern that some package managers have but the fact that there are at least 3 ways to install a thing is wildly baffling.\n4. Certain peripherals require more attention. For example, my Logitech mouse has side buttons that are currently forward/back, but I want to change them to volume up/down. There is a Logitech app for this in Windows, but not for Linux. In other cases, a few things straight up don't work, like my fingerprint scanner.\n\nTo be fair, some of them may come down to just the learning curve and getting used to it, but the amount of effort I need to put into this has hindered productivity at work. They are not \"quick search online and you will find the answer\" like most people have claimed. They are time consuming tasks that may have no result even after hours of research. And to be fair, while I am no computer expert or anything, I am also not a noob that doesn't know what I am doing, and yet I am struggling hard. Not gonna lie it has made me feel really stupid and frustrated.\n\nI don't want to be a hater but honestly it has got to the point that I just feel like Linux desktop sucks now. Note I said desktop. I have always been using Linux for server side and it is fantastic. Linux itself is great, and it's honestly the reason why I wanted to switch in the first place. Like many, I despise many aspects of Windows like the registry, data collection, and overall bloat in the system. But now that WSL does a decent job of allowing dev on Windows to be very Linux-y, is it still worth it to make the switch?

It's feature-ful, fast, and so broadly used that it's well-tested and gets lots of patching, too. It solved problems that were hard, if not impossible, to solve well with sysv (classic example: old sysv init used sleeps waiting for devices, particularly disks, to load. systemd is event-based and fits the kernel's model for how devices get loaded, so no sleep/test sync points needed)\n\nMost systemd opposition does come down to ideology. I'm not going to argue for or against these, I only intend to list them:\n\n* Writing, testing, and maintaining scripts (imperative config -- steps to achieve) gives more flexibility to admins than configuration files (declarative config -- the end state you want)\n* The systemd project has incorporated too many things and isn't UNIX-y enough\n* Personal dislike for some of the key developers\n* It's Linux specific, rather than POSIX, so our *BSD brethren don't benefit\n* Other init systems tried to solve some of the problems systemd wanted to solve, with varying degrees of success, without straying too far from what's familiar\n\nBut in terms of *technical* reasons to prefer something else, I draw a blank. But that's me personally, and part of my bias is being a software guy who has a day job writing Linux server software. systemd took a good chunk of burden off our packaging/deployment by letting us kick scripts to the curb and provide a ton of features like cgroup resource management, auto-restart conditions, all that good stuff. I didn't have any horses in the race other than it solved pain points for us, and that made me want to use it.\n\nEdit: I thought of a technical reason. If you're building a container image that needs multiple processes, you need an init, and getting a full systemd setup is possible but there are extremely lightweight inits to keep your containers simple."}

They are simply shorthands for a series of commands one may like to do frequently, so instead of typing those commands every time, you make a function with them, and then simply call it whenever you want to run it, and you can also pass arguments to them so they can work with external data.\n\nYou define functions by putting it's name, a couple parenthesis, then a couple of curly brackets. Inside those brackets you put the commands that function must run when called. Like this:\n\n    say_hi(){\n        echo \"Hello there!\"\n    }\n\nyou can put one command per line, or all in a single line separated by semicolons.

First I establish the function, and then I run it:\n\n    [mgmx@Battlestar ~]$ welcome() { echo \"hello $USER, the time and date is:\"; date; }\n    [mgmx@Battlestar ~]$ welcome\n    hello mgmx, the time and date is:\n    Tue Jan 30 20:45:54 CST 2024\n    [mgmx@Battlestar ~]$\n\nthe fork bomb uses a function named colon (:) just to seem more \"technical\", but it can be whatever you like. I'm going to call it 'bomb' onwards as simply saying : is awkward.\n\nHere, have this as a shorthand of what I mean: `bomb(){bomb|bomb&};bomb`\n\nNow, what we have inside the bomb function? The bomb function!\n\nYes, this is a thing you can absolutely do. It is called recursion, and it is quite useful and a standard in many programming languages, as sometimes it is easier to do things by dividing it into the same problem, but each time smaller than the previous. Kinda like those Russian Matryoshka dolls.\n\nFor example, if we want a countdown program that types all the numbers from a given number up to 0, we simply print the given number, and then call the same countdown function but with one less. Each time it will print the given number, then call itself back with a lesser number, all until we reach zero.\n\nHere is that in Bash, for example ($1 means the first value we are passing to the function to work on, in this case out countdown starting point):\n\n    countdown(){\n        if [ $1 -ge 0 ]\n        then\n            echo $1\n            countdown $(( $1 - 1 ))\n        else\n            return\n        fi\n    }\n\nAt each step we are checking if $1 is **g**reater or **e**qual (hence the -ge) than zero. If not, we have passed beyond the zero, thus the countdown must stop, hence the return.\n\n...but what if we erase that check? What if we don't tell our recursive function when to stop? The function will call itself endlessly. And each call consumes some CPU and RAM, so we could end up overwhelming our system.\n\nBut why stop there? we can make this recursive chain into a recursive TREE!.\n\nThe vertical bar symbol is used in bash as a \"pipe\". If you put one between two commands, it will take the output of the command at the left, and instead of printing it's output to the screen, it will give that text as the input of the command at the right.\n\nfor example, the `tr` program will **tr**anslate a set of characters into others, so it can be used for example to make lowercase text into uppercase:\n\n    $ echo \"shut up!\"\n    shut up!\n    $ echo \"shut up!\" | tr [:lower:] [:upper:]\n    SHUT UP!\n\nIn the bomb function, we are piping bomb into bomb. That will make two calls of it, and because we haven't made any kind of commands that make output or read input inside bomb, they are going to get stuck in there.\n\nTo avoid that getting stuck, we add the & in front of the last bomb. Putting an ampersand in front of a command runs that command in the background. Think of it when you minimize an app onto the system tray.\n\nAt last, we see a semicolon, which as we saw is a way to run two commands in a line, and in this case, it is calling the bomb function we just defined.\n\nThis means the bomb calls itself twice due the pipe, and then puts that command on the background, so each call can make two more, resulting in 4 instances, then 8, then 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048...\n\n...until the computer cannot hold that anymore."}

All of my programs are written in Bash, and I really like using it, but I know that I need to learn other languages like Python, Ruby, C++, etc. I just can't seem to pick up how to write in those languages, and I always give up and return to Bash. I love how Bash doesn't have to be compiled, I like how it usually doesn't have to be indented or commented, and it's so easy to get a prototype working because the commands are so simple and short. How would you recommend I move away from Bash, and can you give me any strong advantages that other programming languages have that Bash doesn't?\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your insightful replies. I've never posted on this sub before and I was expecting my question to be downvoted and removed because it's a programming question and not a strictly Linux question, but I was pleasantly surprised. I'm going to mark this as \"Solved\" because I think I got the gist of the replies. For people who may see this in the future:\n\n\n1. Other languages are not a 100% replacement for Bash, and you don't have to move to another language if your typical projects are more suited for Bash. For example, system maintenance and task automation scripts are usually much simpler to write in Bash, while you may want to reconsider if you want to use Bash for developing games. (I mean, just look at this: https://pastebin.com/UKXNJJPZ, it's a 2D game demo that took me around 6 hours to make in Bash, and it only requires around 1 minute to beat.)\n\n\n2. Bash is not well suited for very complex data manipulation tasks, and other languages will often complete the same job in a fraction of what it takes Bash to complete the job.\n\n\n3. Bash is less portable. If you're planning on making a program that can run on all different kinds of operating systems and architectures, it's better to use a compiled language for that.\n\n\nEdit 2: I'm now working on a project for GTK3 using Python and Glade.

I've recently tried using ChromeOS on my laptop and the touchpad was way better (but had pretty bad scrolling), and the terminal wasn't Linuxish enough. I couldn't find xorg.conf.d on it. Anyway, the driver was ok, and [someone ported it to Linux](https://github.com/hugegreenbug/libgestures) on Xserver so I wondered if I could install it but it failed because it doesn't support current Ubuntu. Can anyone help me? Or perhaps suggest a solution (distro, package, I'll take ANYTHING!) for a proper touchpad gestures support on Linux? I'd relly appreciate it:)\n\nBtw, I have tried:\n\nLibinput-gestures\nFusuma\nTouchegg\ntwo Wayland touchpad extensions\nSynaptics something\n\nDeepin\n\nChromeOS and ChromiumOS (which were the best so far, but I want REAL Linux)\n\nMacOS (again, not Linux at all and touchpad did't work well)\n\n\n\nEDIT: \n\n\nThanks for the suggestions. I know about [Elementary OS 6](https://blog.elementary.io/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6/) but it's taking forever and I can't tell for sure whether it's good or not until I try it (since it's based on Touchegg with which I haven't had the best experience). \n\nAlso, the features I need the most: \n\n- Functional smooth scrolling. Not the super fast that there's rn.\n- 2-finger accelerated horizontal scrolling to go back & forth browser history. \n- Smooth pinch to zoom gesture systemwide (like on phones, not a ctrl± behaviour)\n- App switching gestures\n- Pointer movement accuracy in general (which's actually pretty ok).\n\n[Here](https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/OS/Gestures) are the gestures the Gnome project has been planning on implementing for a decade, from which I have two: overview activation (not toggle, only activation with 3 finger pinch in and out) and 4 finger workspaces switch with animations that works great. That's all! (and only on Wayland)\n\nAnd one last thing: there's this one guy who is probably one of the few who care about touchpad gestures on Linux more than I do, who is developing a driver (which's not perfect for now), and [here's](https://bill.harding.blog/2020/10/06/q3-linux-touchpad-like-macbook-update-multitouch-gesture-test-packages-are-ready/) his blog", "output": "What is the make and model number of the laptop?\n\nI've used ubuntu for years and haven't had many issues at all with the touchpad drivers...."}

The Linux kernel is located and loaded into RAM, after which control is handed over to it.\n\nThe questions I have are:\n\n1) What are the differences between boot.img and core.img? From what I’ve read online the sole purpose of the boot image is to locate and hand over control to the core image. If that is the case surely both of their tasks could be done by the core image if it were located at sector 0. \n\n2) How does a UEFI boot process differ from a MBR boot process?\n\n3) What are the advantages of UEFI other than more partitions and bigger disk size support? I’ve heard it is more customisable and many parts of the boot process are stored in the filesystem rather than the “hidden” part of the disk after the MBR. Could anyone elaborate on this?\n\nThank you for your time!", "output": "You will find an excellent discussion of the boot process in the Arch Wiki.

The underlying base distro of EndeavourOS, ie Arch Linux, had an out-of-date toolchain issue for many months. Though it has been temporarily solved, the new maintainer is learning while in charge of maintenance. This signals a lack of community involvement in maintaining distros and software, despite the growing linux user base.\n\nNow the issue is that distros based on Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat and SUSE get toolchain and other critical updates from commercial companies, but they're managed by independent volunteers in others. Therefore distros like Mageia, OpenMandriva, PCLinuxOS, Solus are likely to face similar problems in the near future when maintainers leave.

Depending on how paranoid I was feeling, and what I was expecting on the disk, I might just run foremost to extract files, or I might run a filesystem dump utility to individually read the files out, with a tool like libguestfs, anything to avoid mounting it. If I had to mount it, I'd force fsck it, I'd use the nosuid, nodev, noexec, noatime, and nodiratime flags, and maybe force UID and GID to a guest account if the file-system supports owner overrides. I'd run a `file -k` on every file I wanted, paying close attention to anything that came back with more than one type. \n\nEdit: more thoughts: Get the files off quick, and get the USB out of your system ASAP. Don't give it time. Also, be SSHed into the RasPi, so any keystroke attacks are against a text login screen, no opportunity to do anything from a desktop or command line.\n\nBut in a real security situation, high risk, high threat, you wouldn't.

I am contacting the winner!  u/glesialo was the first one with a single-line command using pacmd (or pactl but I went with pacmd because more options if I ever need them).  I embedded that line in an os.system(pacmd suspend-source 1 1|0) on either side of the Speech Synthesizer output and it plugs the robot's ears and unplugs them perfectly.\n\nVIDEO THAT EXPLAINS THIS BETTER:  https://youtu.be/oDgphapTRhM\n\nSYSTEM DETAILS YOU NEED TO BE FAMILIAR WITH: Operating System: Linux (Raspberry Pi OS 64) running on a Raspberry Pi 4B 8 gig, with Python 3.7.3, and AlsaMixer 1.1.8 \n\nBOUNTY OFFERED: First person whose suggestion is accepted and works gets, if you're of age, and permitted legally in your locality and desired, a 12 year old bottle of Glenfidditch or Macallen, your choice, or $75.00, plus the satisfaction of knowing you really helped me keep what's left of my hair. Read below carefully and fully for details. \n\nPROBLEM PART A: When my robot speaks, it's speech recognition script picks up its own speech and attempts to respond to that, creating a feedback loop and making it difficult to get a word in edgewise. \n\nWHAT I'VE TRIED PART A: I'm issuing an os.system amixer sset command to drop 'Capture' to 0 when the robot speaks, and returns 'Capture\" to full (65535) after the speech is complete. According to AlsaMixer and other audio programs that listen to the Mic input, this works perfectly. \n\nPROBLEM PART B: When the Speech Recognition script runs with the above remedy implemented, I get exactly ONE cycle of Listen-Send Speech-Listen, and that's it. The script doesn't die, no errors, it just listens to either actual or software-induced silence, and never (or only rarely, even more frustrating) returns any more recognized speech. \n\nWHAT I'VE TRIED PART B: The Speech Recognition scripts I use are from PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecogn...) and they are nearly flawless. I *do not* believe that the Speech Recognition script is the issue, but I started there to try to pinpoint the problem. I peppered the imported __init__.py script (the actual workhorse of the Speech Recognition system) with print statements at various points, and I've discovered that after it goes through ONE listen-report-listen cycle, it stops on that subsequent listen, ONLY when the Mic volume control statement has been issued in the interim. Without the Mic volume command, it's just does the listen-report-listen cycle perfectly, with the exception of Problem A above - hearing and responding to itself. \n\nALTERNATE OPTIONS: The only other solution I can think of is a hardware solution, and I can't believe with all we can do in Python and Linux that I should have to resort to that, but I also have a script that mutes the actual mic signal using an analog switch - literally disconnecting and reconnecting the mic input signal right at the source. I will not consider a hardware solution to this issue for the bounty. This in Python, on Linux. There's a line of code for this. Somewhere. A group ownership/permissions change - something... \n\nWHAT I WILL NOT CONSIDER AS AN ACCEPTABLE OPTION: Any 3rd-party black-box software; Any hardware solution suggestion (already have that); any unnecessarily contorted script. This is already *mostly* working. As you will see in the video, AlsaMixer sees the audio controls and all of that works well. What *seems* to be happening is that once the control is sent to adjust the Mic volume, something about the Speech Recognition scripts' *connection* to the Mic seems to be broken. Only stopping & restarting the script restores the function - until the very next time the mic volume command is sent. The winning suggestion will be the one that correctly identifies exactly what the problem is and provides the exact steps to fixing it. It doesn't even have to be code, it can be a settings change/permissions change, group ownership change... but I know in my heart that it will be simple. \n\nGood luck!", "output": "Couple of things, do you have an example script that displays this problem? Specifically what commands are you calling and how are you looping. What is the exact line of code it's stopping on (I guess your capture code?)\n\nAnyways, my first guess is what is it supposed to be waiting on to finish? If I had to guess it sets up some impossible trigger after being initialized with the microphone off, and then never returns. This would be very helpful to fire up a debugger and trace it through the code (is it spinning, high CPU when this happens?). Does this problem happen if you don't set the capture volume to  0? What if you use mute/unmute instead of specifying a volume?\n\nSecond, are simply changing the volume when listening? Have you tried stopping and starting it, does that change the outcome?\n\nAnd what about not using alsamixer, specifically, most things use pulse now, so have you tried changing the microphone with pavucontrol. Did you specify the input methods?\n\nAnd finally, if this was me I'd probably attempt to filter the input and remove the output from the input (I'd probably put the speech output through a few narrow bandpass filters with the reverse filter on the input), then you can talk to it while it's talking and it can understand over its own voice."}

Debian is an extremely robust distro. No other distro has as many packages as Debian does, and it's actually *shrunk* in the last decade. So there was always a gigantic amount of software choice. For instance few other distros allowed you to pick whichever DE you wanted no issues. This makes it easy for software packagers, because if you need a dependency, chances are its already in the repo and you don't have to reinvent the wheel.\n\n2. It was a binary distro, which coupled with 1 made it really easy for new users to get into: you just download the packages and go, at a time when a lot of other distros required compiling a lot of stuff yourself manually, which was a big barrier to entry. This is less of a big deal these days, but it causes a lot of inertia.\n\n3. Canonical and Ubuntu. And, despite the flak they often rightfully get, this is the biggest one. Canonical put a metric *fuckton* of effort into making a new-user-friendly distro based on Debian. Many quality-of-life things that are easy to take for granted these days were due to Canonical actually putting in the effort. And thus, it became a huge base of users from which sprang many dozens of child distros which brought even more new users in. I got my start with Linux in 2007 with Ubuntu 7.10, and have been a Debian user continuously on everything (every daily driver device, home and work) since 2013. Had it not been for Ubuntu 7.10 and especially 8.04 with some major QoL fixes, I probably wouldn't have tried Linux, and I'm certain I'm not alone there.

{"id": "haokjv", "instruction": "Interested in moving to Linux, but have a few questions", "input": "Seen a lot of videos that has convinced me to make the move, especially now where the gap is extremely close. Another reason I'm moving to Linux is because I want to delve into coding and I think putting myself in an environment where that 'might' be necessary could help me out. Because of the pandemic, I have much extra time and I just can't let this opportunity pass up.\n\nI do have the usual \"What distribution should I use?\" question. I have a particular set of needs that is difficult to narrow down. I do a lot of gaming and most of it is via Steam, though there are interesting games popping out in EGS so that might be something I should consider. It's easy to Google people recommending which distributions to use when it comes to gaming.\n\nHowever, my additional issue is that I work as the sole Mech Engr in my workplace and sideline as a designer. Because of this, I receive a lot of files, letters, and the like sometimes as MSWord and MSExcel. I currently use Libre Office at home and that sometimes breaks the formatting of said files - I'm hoping there's an alt in Linux or a certain distro that could help with that.\n\nMy bigger problem though is for the design. Almost everyone uses AutoCAD, and sadly I have no license of my own to be able to use it (I live in Philippines, and even though no one could afford it here with our income, everyone pirates it, sadly). I have to ensure my files can be read by the Architect without issue so that he could include my design in the overall submission. Before I make the switch, I want to ensure that there's something out that works for Linux and could produce drawings that is almost fully compatible with AutoCAD. I can't stress this enough, I want to ensure there is very little compromise for this.\n\nThere's also other programs I use like stress and fluids sims, and similar. But those are usually for learning and not necessarily for work, so I don't mind making much more compromises for those.\n\nHoping people could help me out. Thanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: I guess I should also clarify that I'm not entirely sure what separates most distros from others. I.e. will gaming-focused distros work well only with games but are horrible with CAD software, are there certain applications that work much better on some distros compared to others, etc.\n\nIn my particular case, I'm not sure if a distro with good Steam support might have compromises in other stuff like its support for spreadsheet and CAD software. Do these compromises even existent, or is the groundwork for most distros so well polished now that it's alright to assume that all of them could also support the mentioned software with little to no issue, etc.\n\n\\---------------------------------\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThank you everyone for entertaining my queries! I'm glad I approached this community first, considering how open and honest you all are.\n\nI've read most of the comments here, and it seems that though a great ton of you have recommended some distros, there is a vocal majority that say it's better to dual boot, and a few saying to stick to Windows with a Linux VM. I kind of wanted to just stick to Linux so that, if ever something irritates me, I couldn't easily go back to the \"safe space\" that is Windows. However, with how much people are recommending dual boot, it kind of gave me the feeling that having a way to access Windows is a necessity. \n\nTo be honest, I really just wanted to learn how to do some programming and thought moving to Linux might help with that and put me in an environment to 'force' me to learn, so to speak - apart from the fact that there are a lot of \"to Linux and never came back\" stories around the net so the other side must certainly have greener pastures, right? Now I kind of feel like I'm not giving Linux the treatment it deserves.\n\nI've decided to stick with Windows for now and hone my craft there, while also learn more complex programming there too. Once I get better, maybe I'll use a Linux VM. Most likely, I'll only decide to fully move to Linux once the gap between it and the two OS giants are extremely close, which I think will only be a matter of time. \n\nAgain, I thank everyone! I apologize if it seemed like I'm misusing Linux from it's real purpose.", "output": "I'm surprised no one mentioned this, but there's an online version of the Microsoft Office Suite! You can literally use Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc. from a Linux machine, because there's a webapp version!\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/free-office-online-for-the-web\n\nIt even says it's free. I assume you need a legit Windows and/or Office key, but you do, so that's no problem. Disclaimer: I have personally not used this, so I can't vouch for it at all, I just know of it because of this great Youtuber, ExplainingComputers, who I strongly suggest you check out -- he's a lifelong Windows user who has decided to make the switch to Linux after the end of Windows 7, yet needs Windows for work reasons. I think you'll find his perspective relatable and useful \\^_\\^\n\nI don't feel anyone has really answered \"what's the difference between distros\" very well, so I'll try my hand.\n\nSo, technically, Linux is not an operating system. Linux is a kernel that people build other software on top of. Android phones use the Linux kernel, for instance. So do most web servers and supercomputers.\n\nBasically, a distro is just a collection of software that runs on the Linux kernel, that's hand-selected by the distro's maintainers (usually a group of nerds, but sometimes a company) to fashion an operating system out of.\n\nYou can literally download almost any distro, and by installing certain software and uninstalling or reconfiguring others, make it identical to any other distro. I say \"almost\" because there ARE some closed-source programs in Linux that certain distros use, but it's mostly open.\n\nThe REAL difference between distros, the MEANINGFUL difference, is 1) the release cycle and 2) the community.\n\nAs for release cycle, some distros push out updates to software the moment they're available. This means you're always on the cutting edge, but you could also wreck your system. Other distros have a much more infrequent updates and are much more stable, because they hold back on updates until major version updates of software prove themselves stable and reliable on a majority of machines.\n\nAs for the community, that's an equally important concern. A distro with a small, inactive community would be awful, no matter how technically well put-together the distro itself is, because any time you'd have trouble or questions, there'd be no one around to help, and problems would go unresolved for long periods of time.\n\nAlso, different communities have very different attitudes and userbases. Some are more filled with casual users, some more with gamers, some with power users, some with very philosophical folk who reject all non-open-source software, some with security afficionados. You'll find all types everywhere, but there's definite trends.\n\nNow, you mentioned you'd potentially like a distro that forces you to learn. I'd say, check out Arch Linux. Not necessarily to use permanently, but definitely to try out. Arch Linux is basically a \"build your own Linux operating system toolkit\" -- when installed, it's just basic file commands and a method of connecting to the internet and downloading packages. You have to choose and install everything yourself, and the Arch Linux wiki is a fantastic source of information that explains it all in great detail. Indeed, most users of other distros rely on the Arch wiki.\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide\n\nNow, you don't have to end up permanently using the machine you build, but you WILL learn a TON about how Linux works along the way, and will be much better equipped to understand other distros thereafter, so you can make an informed choice on your own.\n\nOne last thing I'll say, since this is already an overlong comment, is that depending on your hardware setup, you may want to look into doing hardware passthrough via VirtualBox and run Windows in a virtual machine on your new Linux machine. I haven't personally used AutoCAD, but people get modern high-end gaming running at 99.9% in a virtual machine by doing hardware passthrough, so I'd imagine there'd at least be a decent chance of AutoCAD performing well.\n\nHope I helped!"}

Here is a good [counterpoint](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/u2v8bq/comment/i4ldmoq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to my excitement about flatpak though.\n4. Gnome and KDE are steadily improving and being refined. Gnome in particular has been making some big-ish positive steps lately I think, and I'm excited to see where that leads. KDE has been making more incremental/steady, but still positive progress.\n5. Immutable distros like Fedora Silverblue, not sure its my cup of tea, and some of it goes over my head, but I understand (some of) the appeal, and am excited to see the progress.\n6. Face tagging / facial recognition (this seems to be perpetually a pre-alpha thing in Linux). I really like my personal photo library to be organizable by 'people' / automatically group by face. But I don't trust this sensitive data to cloud services, or big tech (advertising/tracking companies) like Google, etc. If this could be done locally, on device, this would make me happy. digikam and shotwell have been on the edge of implementing these features for years but never seem to get there. Deepin apparently, has made some progress here, I haven't looked into it, but hope it may be picked up by other projects."}

I watch Mental Outlaw's videos on YouTube and I find them very informative and even entertaining. I was wondering given it's complexity, what exactly is the appeal of Gentoo over say Debian or Manjaro? As I understand, Gentoo is completely compiled from source, and all its packages need to be manually compiled by the user. I was hoping to hear from some Gentoo users about their experience and also what they like about it. I'm also looking to be educated about the subject. Thank you!", "output": "I'm not using Gentoo right now, but I used it for several years (years ago, so my impressions might be out of date). I'd say Gentoo is an enthusiast/technical user sort of distro. If you just want to do stuff, I'd say you'd be better off with something else. That said, it has upsides:\n\n* You can squeeze out more performance by compiling specifically to your computer's CPU. This doesn't matter much to most people, but could be a benefit if you want to get the most of low power hardware, or do some sort of very intense processing where a gain of 10% would be noticeable.\n* You get more ability to use new and experimental compiler technologies. \n* You get a lot more ability to decide exactly what you're going to build support for. Besides the performance reasons this is sometimes helpful if some piece of functionality you can do without proves troublesome. \n* You're interested in something right at the bleeding edge. Gentoo makes it quite easy to try the very latest code, or to apply patches to system software.\n* It's somewhat more convenient to build stuff on, since all the tools and dependencies will already be installed. So if you want to try some new program that isn't packaged yet anywhere, it can be easier to make it build on something like Gentoo.\n\nMy personal take: Use it if you think it sounds like something cool to mess around with, or if you have an actual use case like the above. Don't use it for anything critical, or anything you wouldn't want to see in an unusable state for a few hours/days.\n\nAlso, Gentoo has a package manager. You don't compile stuff by hand, the package manager compiles everything for you. It's just that installing anything involves the package manager downloading and compiling source."}

I'm writing this on the latest Ubuntu. I run Manjaro on my laptop. I generally install Linux Distros on a whole bunch of things. **I often end up using many of these packaging solutions.** And I realize the advantages they can bring, I just can't seem to figure out where all of the complaints are coming from and exactly how these systems work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Is there any real, evident reason not to use snaps?** What I mean is, there's plenty of people talking about how the Snap backend and all of its server-side functions are entirely dependant on Canonical, and how it's up to them to pick who gets to be on the store. But I've never actually seen any drama or complaints about Canonical not cooperating with developers or violating the user's privacy. If you have, could you please point me to a few of your sources? I'm honestly interested in reading up about these things, and every crappy YouTube video going over the same bullet points isn't helping out.

But there's a lot of high profile developers providing their apps on the Snap Store, some of them even exclusively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Is performance really worse with snaps?** I have been using a Minecraft snap and haven't really seen a difference. My 2FA manager, Authy, is exclusively available in the Snap Store, and that has been performing better than on Windows. But then, I hear so many users complaining about performance, especially on the first launch. Is that the case, and does anyone have any data pointing to that conclusion? Once again, I'd love to read up on the technicalities of the matter. But as a simple user, SquashFS sounds like a good way to reduce random reads, and thus improve performance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Are Flatpaks (or AppImages for that matter) TECHNICALLY superior?** I understand that not being limited to the Flathub is Flatpak's big advantage, similar to how every package manager can have its own repositories. But, as a distribution format, is it actually better? Is the performance better? And, most importantly, is it easier to develop and support? Which one of these solutions is more likely to work out of the box, both for developers and end-users? I watched a presentation on some of the inner workings on Flatpaks, but it honestly went over my head. As an outsider, both Snaps and Flatpaks seem to have the same technical limitations, but I'd love to figure out the intricate differences between the two. And, lastly, how sustainable is their system moving forwards? Is it ready to take on even bigger projects and codebases that interact with even more parts of your system?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Finally, and most importantly, which one of these is easier to develop and publish for?** Coming from Manjaro and Arch back to Debian, it was clear that the single biggest advantage (and disadvantage) was the AUR. It succeeded because it was easy to use and open to everyone. Could these packaging methods be as easy to develop for as the AUR? Taking a look at the Snap website and the Snapcraft GitHub, it's clear to me that the team has spent a lot of their time on documenting the process of creating a Snap and making sure development is easy to get started and smooth to upkeep. I can't find similarly detailed information and starting points for the other two solutions. And none of these matches the simplicity of the AUR. But, if there was ever a chance that one of these solutions could become similar to the AUR, which one would it be? As a software developer, which one would you choose?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you read all of that, thank you so much.

This laptop has the latest Windows 10 64bit on it, but the problem is that despite my best efforts there are all sorts of background internet things happening including downloading updates. This is despite the fact that I've turned off all such updating processes that I can find. The reason why this is a problem is because I get my internet through a smart phone and my data cap for the month is 10gb, after which my speeds get dropped to a wholly unusable 125kb. \n\nSince I can't fight Windows on this anymore, would some flavor of linux be appropriate? I figure all the basics would be available for linux like the GUI, various basic apps, and browsers. The main question would be the video editing, but I just use Windows Movie Maker for that, it's really simple. Basically, I don't want anything using any data at all unless I explicitly allow it to, and ideally it would be nice if I had some sort of accurate data use tracker so I could better manage my data cap. Currently if I am very frugal with my data usage I can usually get two, maybe three weeks into my month before hitting the cap.\n\nThe laptop has a Core i5 M 520 processor running at 2.4GHz with 4GB RAM.\n\nEdit: My thoughts so far: Awesome info!

I ended up not going with a linux install at the time, something I still think of as a mistake. I remember them being a fun and interesting bunch of people, for sure! I also remember that hardware compatibility was more of a problem back then, especially with laptops, but that no longer seems like the case. Whatever distro I choose I will get a friend of mine to download for me. Can the install run off an optical drive, or would USB be better or more efficient?

However, I understand that 14.04 is not supported any more and I'm a big supporter of \"no insecure operating systems on the network\".

This is what `dpkg` (Debian) does.\n\n1. `apt` downloads .deb files from remote repositories and resolves all dependencies. The lot of .deb files are handed off to `dpkg` for installation.\n2. Each .deb file contains some metadata and the binaries, configuration files, assets, and libraries that need to be installed. The .deb package is actually nothing more than a simple archive file. Inside that archive is the `control` file. This contains information like the package version, the dependencies, who the maintainer is, the name, and a short description. It also contains a miniature Linux file system. You'll see a /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /var, and more in the archive.\n3. Upon installation, the contents of these folders are copied verbatim into the real /usr, /var, /etc, and so on.\n4. A post-install script is sometimes run to start or restart affected system services, prepare configuration files, or anything else that might need to be done."}

{"id": "swx2ro", "instruction": "Researcher looking to LUKS encrypt sensitive data on Ubuntu Desktop 20.04.3 -- How secure is my setup really?", "input": "I want to switch from Windows 10 to Ubuntu 20.04.3 for security and privacy reasons. I am a researcher and sometimes work and travel in a country where the government expects you do find results that agree with their current ideological views, so I need **all of my data to be password protected**. I'm not a terrorist, so nobody is going to break down my door any time soon, but hardware seizures by corrupt police forces are not unheard of.\n\nMy **threat model** looks like this. Absolute worst case scenario: corrupt police force seizing my computer plus hard drives and start hammering on the drives with **Hashcat and a medium sized GPU / ASIC cluster for a few months** trying to get to my data. This would be the time period that a lawyer needs to get my hardware back. Having a secure 100+ bit passphrase goes without saying, of course.\n\nI'm not worried about the NSA/CIA tracking me down and using some kind of supercomputer, because honestly, I'm not interesting enough for that. Let's assume that the 5$ wrench attack is not an option right now - because you cannot really protect yourself against that. Instead, I'm trying to focus on the things that I CAN change. I may be paranoid but not THAT paranoid.\n\nI have done about a weeks worth of research and have tried setting up LUKS with multiple guides and on multiple VMs for practice. I do believe that I was somewhat successful. Unfortunately, **\"a little bit of skill\" is more dangerous than \"no skill at all\"**. So my Linux knowledge was good enough to set it up, but I don't trust myself enough to actually gauge the level of security I have produced.\n\nAs an example, Windows likes to save temporary files in obscure, random locations. Maybe Linux does this as well, and if they're not part of the LUKS encrypted partition then that's a possible attack vector. The same goes for the swap file and any hibernation images of the RAM that might get stored on disk.\n\nThe main guide I have followed is on the Ubuntu docs wiki: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Full_Disk_Encryption_Howto_2019\n\nIt also tells you to encrypt /boot. Unfortunately, this has given me some trouble and I honestly don't know if encrypting /boot is necessary in my case. I do believe it prevents the evil maid attack, but I believe that if somebody was to gain physical access to my device I would have lost anyways? I assume an encrypted /boot does not prevent malware from manipulating the kernel, as it would have to be decrypted on boot anyways?\n\nAlso, I cannot use a very secure password for the encrypted /boot directory, simply because GRUB needs to decrypt it and GRUB only accepts keyboard input with a US keyboard layout. So if I want to use special characters or things like Y and Z, they will be on different positions depending on the keyboard I use. So the GRUB password would have to be a relatively simple one anyway (alphanumeric, without Y, Z or special characters). I'm not sure how relevant this is though. It also makes it more tedious to boot the computer, as I need to enter the /boot password first for GRUB, then the data password second and then the /boot password yet again for Ubuntu.\n\nRight now, I don't know if following this (somewhat difficult) guide is giving me any additional protection, so I'm leaning towards just using the much easier graphical installer provided by **Ubuntu Desktop 20.04.3**. It doesn't specifically mention LUKS, but the way I understand it is, it first encrypts the data partition with LUKS and then uses some kind of volume management (LVM) to manage it. I assume this also includes all operating system files? ( https://i.imgur.com/AlsVIPj.png )\n\nDoing it with the graphical installer does feel \"too easy\", in that I don't really trust it enough to be secure. Like, could it actually be this easy to encrypt ALL of my data? I'm used to Windows making it much more difficult. And again, I don't know enough about Linux' filesystem to gauge the security I get with this.\n\nI did enable the \"overwrite empty disk space\" option, because I've read that the wear-level and TRIM features on modern NVMEs can provide a risk of data leak and that somebody may be able to find out where the encrypted drive begins and ends? I'm not sure how relevant this is to me ( https://i.imgur.com/bErMG3O.png )\n\nIf I understand the prompt correctly, it should put the swapfile on the encrypted drive by default? So any sensitive data in RAM will only ever be written to the encrypted part. What happens if I don't shutdown the computer, but put it into hibernation mode? ( https://i.imgur.com/A2TAmmn.png )\n\nAlso, does the wear-leveling on NVMEs somehow put my data in danger? If the NVME cannot differentiate between empty space and encrypted space, is there a possibility of the SSD controller writing data to the wrong place and deleting a part of my encrypted drive?\n\nWhen you're encrypting a hard drive, you can encrypt it \"in place\" as you can write to specific blocks directly and you basically get to decide where to put the encrypted data. SSDs don't allow for that and in the end, the controller is going to decide where to place your data depending on the wear level of the memory cells. So if you tried to encrypt an operating system in place, it would probably write the encrypted data somewhere else and leave a copy of the unencrypted data at the beginning of the drive, right? This would leave the device open to be read and may lead to somebody reading out some passwords. https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Trim%20Operation.html\n\nAfter installing Ubuntu I get this prompt. It does suggest that the operating system and data have been encrypted. ( https://i.imgur.com/bAyznsc.png )\n\nFor this part, Ubuntu takes into account my local keyboard layout, so I would use a very secure passphrase with 100+ bits of entropy, such as \"exact respect aspire trench schilling trustless document serve\".\n\nAll things considered, this does suggest that I'm somewhat protected, but I don't know how secure this setup really is, so I could use another opinion. Maybe you guys can see any open holes, unencrypted parts of the drive where I might accidentally write data to, temp / swapfiles that are not protected, RAM hibernation images that are unencrypted and provide the option to read out the password. Things like that.\n\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nI am a researcher and need to protect all of my data against (in the worst case) a corrupt government in a foreign country - is ALL of my data secure against medium sized attacks with Hashcat provided I use a strong 100+ bit passphrase? ( https://paste.debian.net/hidden/28448e38 )\n\n    OS: Ubuntu 20.04.3\n    Hardware: i5 6600k, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB NVME SSD", "output": "Overall this approach is fine (yes, swap is encrypted, yes, the Ubuntu installer uses sane defaults for encryption) although there are some things to keep in mind:\n\n* Disk encryption doesn't protect you against malware or getting hacked. Your corrupt government might be just as likely to hire a hacker to pwn you as break your door down and steal your hard drive.\n* Plausibly deniable encryption is a good thing in your situation. A hard drive full of random bits feels very secure but you may as well also put a note on it that says \"hello mr. officer sir i have Very Important Secrets i don't want the government knowing about look here for Secrets\"\n   * A veracrypt hidden volume on an external hard disk drive -- NOT an SSD -- might be a better fit for your needs. Put some normal, boring data on the unencrypted part of the drive as a decoy, keep your research data in the hidden volume.\n* Cloud storage with a provider not in your country and who won't cooperate with your country's law enforcement is not a bad idea, but don't just upload everything to Google, okay? If you're being attacked by a government then they can create a legal veneer for whatever they're doing and big cloud providers aren't going to fight a \"lawful warrant\" (or equivalent in your jurisdiction) for you."}
