Here’s the breakdown:\n\n1. **Endless forms** with useless questions that took **10+ hours** to complete.\n2. **IQ-style test** (for some reason).\n3. **Language test**—seriously, why?\n\nAfter passing those, I moved to the interview stages:\n\n1. **Technical interview** – Python coding.\n2. **Manager interview** – Career discussions (with the hiring team).\n3. **Another tech interview** – System architecture and general tech questions.\n4. **HR interview** – Career-related topics, but HR had no clue about salary expectations.\n5. **Another manager interview** (not in the hiring team).\n6. **Hiring lead interview** – Positive feedback.\n7. **VP interview** – **Very positive feedback**, I was literally told, *\"You tick all the boxes for this position.\"*\n\nEventually, I **received an offer**. Since I was already employed, I resigned to start in four weeks. Even though the salary—revealed **only after four months**—was underwhelming, it was a bit higher than my previous job, so I accepted. The emotional toll of the long process made me push forward.\n\n# And then, the disaster…\n\nOne week after accepting the offer, I woke up to an email from the hiring manager stating that, after further discussions with upper management, they had decided to cancel my application.\n\nWhat upper management? No one ever mentioned this step. And why did this happen after I received an offer?\n\nI sent a few polite and respectful emails asking for an explanation. No response. Neither from my hiring manager nor HR.\n\nNow, I’m left starting from scratch (if not worse), struggling to pay my bills.\n\n# My advice if you’re considering Canonical:\n\n* Prepare emotionally for a very long process.\n* Expect childish behavior like this.\n* Never resign until you’ve actually started working.\n\nI would never recommend Canonical to anyone I care about.

Like most Linux users, I'm an ex-Windows user. Now when it came to windows, I considered myself rather adept at troubleshooting and solving windows problems. I was that guy in your family or friends group that was the default \"IT guy\" - no matter what problem you were having. Most of the time I was able to solve things, navigate around comfortably, try troubleshoot steps, the whole lot. *However...* Since I migrated over to Linux (full-time) about a year ago, I've noticed that a lot of the muscle memory and general knowledge about windows has just sort of... faded away.\n\nI'm still the \"IT guy\" in my social circle, most of whom use windows, so I often get questions about how to do X or solve Y in windows 10/11.

If it's not something *rather* obvious or easy to fix, I tend to struggle.
